2016-09-23,"exceeded my expectations",10,"Fortunate enough to get a real good deal for a Business Class ticket on the inaugural Wellington to Canberra flight on 21 Sept 2016. Check in was quick and efficient, boarding was even quicker. Short Haul Business Class cabin in a 2-2-2 configuration, very comfortable and I found it quite spacious. Cabin crew very friendly as you expect from Singapore Airlines. A little pomp and ceremony being the first every B777-200 commercial flight out of Wellington, the first flight between Wellington and Canberra. Flight was fairly full, only a few seats left here and there. Quick take off and the service began with bubbles of course, food was really tasty and restaurant quality. Cabin crew very attentive, engaging and we had a few laughs along the way too. Flight was smooth, lie flat bed was flat and comfortable, still managed a few zzz's before landing. Seat comfort itself was great and inflight entertainment system, well I didn't try it at all, we were too busy having bubbles and food and laughs. Was a great flight and Singapore Airlines exceeded my expectations on this trip by far!","Skytrax"
2016-09-22,"not let instruments as carry on",1,"Brisbane to London via Singapore. Would not recommend flying with Singapore Airlines if you are a musician who values their instruments. Never had any trouble with taking my guitar on other flights but as I went to book into my flight at Brisbane I was told that it was not company policy to let people take instruments on board and that I'd have to stow it under the plane. After a long discussion with the manager about how I've never had any trouble before and that it'd easily fit in an overhead onboard the aircraft she said to come back to the desk at around 9:30 when the crew would arrive, so I could ask them if I could be made an exception. I came back at 9 to be told that the crew had already arrived and said no so I would have to stow the instrument, I was then made to sign a form to waive my right to sue if the instrument was damaged before boarding the aircraft. I was assured by the staff that the guitar would be treated with the utmost care and I tried to put it to the back of my mind and enjoy the flight. Upon arriving back home I'm sad to see the wood on the head of the guitar has split and two of the tuning pegs have been damaged meaning my guitar which has traveled the world with me is now no more than an expensive ornament. What made me really dissapointed was being told there wouldn't be enough room on the aircraft for my guitar and then seeing 3 overhead compartments directly next to me free of any carry on luggage and plenty of seats free for it to have been stored. I know it's not Singapore Airlines policy to let people take instruments as carry on but I'm less than impressed about being lied to about not having enough room onboard and the fact that every other airline I've flown has had no problems with it. Apart from the guitar the flight was lovely, food amazing, staff were very friendly and the stewardess knew how to make a mean White Russian! Just wouldn't advise any musicians to take the risk and lose their beloved instrument.","Skytrax"
2016-09-12,"found the aircraft to be dated",7,"Cape Town to Ko Samui via Singapore. The flight departed on time, with staff efficient and friendly. The standard and quantity of food offered has dropped. Staff work very hard, are intelligent and friendly. I found the aircraft to be dated, and the inflight entertainment quite limited. The aircraft was spotless, but again the 70's interior feel, and the lack of a decent IFE offer was disappointing. It reminds of the flights I took in the 90's. The seat was comfortable and the leg room was adequate. The second leg to Samui was a standard quick hop from Singapore with a superior plane and staff.","Skytrax"
2016-09-07,"couldn't fault this flight",10,"Singapore to Munich. Check in was great, straight up to the desk. Used the business class lounge which was good to have a bite to eat and relax. This aircraft had the new business class seat and the reviews are right - it is the best business seat I've come across. Heaps of room and your own little compartment. Had 3 course meal before bed. The bed was great with myself 6'4 being able to totally lay stretched out and get hours of sleep. Booked the cook and had the full English breakfast before landing. Couldn't fault this flight one bit.","Skytrax"
2016-08-29,"a superior travel experience",9,"I booked a flight from Melbourne to Trivandrum via Singapore. I had a great connection - only 4 hours transit in Singapore. A few weeks later my SilkAir India flight was rescheduled. However Singapore Airlines provided me with a hotel for the day, transfers and meals. So although delayed for a day I got to go sight seeing in Singapore and had a rest at a very nice hotel. Previously I flew Etihad to India via Abu Dhabi. However Etihad has 10 abreast seating on the 777 and it was a 14 hour flight and very uncomfortable. I chose Singapore Airlines for the 9 abreast seating on the 777 and the 8 hour flight to Singapore which was much more enjoyable. The service with Singapore Airlines was excellent including hot towels and fantastic cabin crew. Changi Airport was a beautiful place to visit and Singapore is a beautiful city for a stopover. I totally recommend Singapore Airlines, Silk Air and Changi Airport for a superior travel experience when you have a choice!","Skytrax"
2016-08-26,"an average flying experience",6,"I flew from Brisbane to Beijing to Perth with Singapore Airlines via Singapore. Apart from the one leg on the A380 (PEK-SIN), the other legs were operated by old and tired aircraft with cabin interiors that said as much. The FAs were the usual attentive and professional SQ Girls & Boys and the IFE was ""well stocked"" but I wasn't able to enjoy it because it kept crackling and, on at least two occasions, the movie re-started itself. In the end we got to our destinations safely and on time, I guess. Overall, it was an average flying experience.","Skytrax"
2016-08-20,"standard of service being dropped",4,"Singapore to Tokyo Narita. The service was horrible with staff not as polite or welcoming as they use to be in the earlier flights experienced. I noticed the standard of service being dropped and the inflight entertainment system was horribly maintained. I ordered a drink from the air hostess but then she said that she wasn't free and would bring it in a while but 30 minutes passed no sight of her nor my drink.  The entertainment system remote being beside you at the seat was discomforting as whenever you pulled it your elbows would disturb the person beside you.","Skytrax"
2016-08-16,"best I have experienced in economy",9,"London to Denpasar Bali via Singapore. This was my first flight with Singapore Airlines. Both flights were extremely busy but boarding was efficiently handled. The baggage allowance of 30kgs for economy is excellent. We had only a short connection time in Singapore which could have been an issue hadn't the Heathrow flight got in early. Both flights were supposed to have used Terminal 2 in Singapore making in theory the transfer straightforward. The Heathrow flight arrived at Terminal 3 however while the Bali flight left from Terminal 1 which made for a longer transfer. The inflight entertainment system is good but not quite as good as Emirates. I was really impressed with the food and drink offered. I had a curry on the flight to Singapore which was excellent as was the ice cream served as a sweet. There was also a good selection of beers, wines and spirits. Snacks and drinks were available throughout the 13 hour flight to Singapore. The cabin staff were extremely attentive. Overall I was really impressed with the quality of the service and would say it was the best I have experienced in economy from any of the major airlines I have travelled with.","Skytrax"
2016-08-15,"all seats are changed",3,"London to Hong Kong via Singapore. Basically everything in the flight is ok but on the ground it does not match any Singapore Airlines standards anymore. First, when I arrived at the terminal ground at Changi airport, the staff told me that all seats are changed since there is an aircraft change. But I remembered when the tickets are booked, it is still an A380 and when I arrived at the gate, the same model appears at the airport. If really there is a better reason to shuffle all our seats even when we book it 3 months before, I think Singapore Airlines should explain to us since we are not the only one complaining at the time.","Skytrax"
2016-08-15,"don't feel there was anything special",7,"Hanoi to Singapore with Singapore Airlines. I feel that my expectations were really high and I don't feel like there was anything special about Singapore Airlines. The seat was wide and the IFE system was fantastic, but I found the food to be terrible and the flight attendants kind of rude.","Skytrax"
2016-08-14,"hard product and soft product are very impressive",10,"There's a simple reason why Singapore Airlines is always rated amongst the very top airlines in the world. They're excellent. Both their hard product and soft product are very impressive and consistent which is not easy to achieve. This 17.5 hour flight from Singapore to San Francisco (via Hong Kong) is absolutely heavenly. The 777-300ER has the next gen First Class cabin which is noticeably different from the previous first class. The leather is firmer, the design more fresh with subtle colour adjustments and the seat has many new compartments to store all your onboard 'necesseties'. The IFE has also been completely revamped with a great new remote system which is very intuitive and easy to use. Love that you can now quickly rate movies that you watch. The dining is amazing. As if I was sitting in a fine restaurant in town. I love ordering via Book the Cook for I can specifically choose my meals for every part of the flight. Excellent job SQ.","Skytrax"
2016-08-13,"it is completely inconsistent",8,"Although the service and food were excellent on this short, less than two hour flight from Bangkok to Singapore, the plane was the very old 777-200, with the very old business class. The recline chairs upholstered in the dated blueish-purple fabrics. I think Singapore Airlines has only three of these left. I hope SQ gets rid of these planes soon for it is completely inconsistent with their other excellent equipment.","Skytrax"
2016-08-12,"The service was excellent",7,"New Delhi to Denpasar via Singapore on business class on Velocity Points Redemption. SQ did not offer A380 business class seats for our travel dates from Delhi. Flight timings were convenient as the flight happened throughout the day bringing passengers into Bali via Singapore by late evening. The service was excellent, barring a negative moment on the SIN-DPS sector. Ground staff in New Delhi were kind to allow me to hand in a package to my driver which I was careless about. They collected it at the gate and made proper inquiries with me before agreeing to handover the envelope to my driver who came to collect it later. SilverKris Lounge in DEL was average in terms or service or offer and reflected the usual attributes of airlines offering mediocre service at Indian airports. Due to Indian regulations no champagne is served on boarding Business Class in India. Flight attendants were friendly and the business class product had no concerns. In-flight entertainment options aren't as large as Emirates, but had an eclectic selection of movies to select from. From SIN-DPS, we encountered a scenario which left a sour taste of the experience. The offered menu had an option of beef. Living in India good beef is hard to come across, so the plan was to indulge in beef on the way to DPS, since beef options were not available on the DEL-SIN sector. On requesting for a beef dish, I was advised that they had run out of beef and was offered the option of chicken or seafood. No apologies or offers to check if an economy meal was available. My partner chose not to have a meal since he wasn't keen on the seafood or the chicken. At this point three members of the cabin crew apologised profusely to him and assured him that they would do anything possible to make things better. At this point my partner asked the crew why the same apologies or service recovery efforts were not made with me, and the crew member simply mentioned, 'I'm sorry but we weren't aware that you were travelling together!' They tried to make up for the error by plying us with drinks and making multiple trips to the seat to inquire of our well-being.","Skytrax"
2016-08-10,"I'd still prefer Emirates",6,"Brisbane to Beijing via Singapore. I'd never flown Singapore Airlines before and was looking forward to it. The FAs were attentive on both sectors (BNE/SIN and SIN/PEK) and the food was nice. That's about it. The IFE on both sectors was well-stocked but I found it difficult to hear because it was crackling and kept starting/stopping. Most of the Singapore Airlines reviews must be for business class. I'd still prefer Emirates over Singapore Airlines having now given them a go.","Skytrax"
2016-08-09,"SIA still sets the standard",9,"Auckland to Singapore. Very good overall, with the usual attentive and friendly service by cabin crew combined with, on this 2-year old plane, a very comfortable seat - helped by SIA only having 9-abreast seating on the Boeing 777-300ER. Seat back screen (Panasonic) was very generously sized and gave a clear picture, but the instructions were far from intuitive. Even with good headphones, film dialogue was often hard to follow, but after trawling through the buttons trying to select a sub-title option to compensate I gave up and called for cabin crew help. The steward took several minutes to find the magic button, but was himself too confused to explain how he'd found his way to it. That apart, the entertainment selection was extensive and even when the passenger in front reclined her seat the TV screen tilted enough to enable comfortable viewing. SIA still sets the standard for long-haul economy.","Skytrax"
2016-08-05,"it is well worth it",9,"Flew Manchester to Singapore via Munich. Left Manchester on a Boeing 777-300ER, the aircraft was new. I have not been with Singapore Airlines for a while, the service was very good, the flight attendants were friendly especially from Munich and the food was plentiful and very tasty. The inflight entertainment was very good. All round you pay a bit more for Singapore Airlines but it is well worth it.","Skytrax"
2016-08-05,"efficient but impersonal",8,"We flew out premium economy and back economy from Johannesburg to Kuala Lumpur via Changi. I haven't flown with Singapore Airlines for about 10 years so was expecting a very pleasant flight. The aircraft was brand new and it all looked good and it was except for the attendants. I can't really put my finger on it other than it was impersonal, efficient but impersonal. They seemed to be in an awful rush to get us fed and watered and turn the lights off. You didn't see them after that at all and we were in premium economy on the way out. On the way back the flight left at 2am and after hanging around in the airport I was hoping for some good food. However it was not too be ! A sandwich was it ! You could ask for snacks but who wants crisps at 3am ? I felt rather disappointed","Skytrax"
2016-08-01,"service was less friendly or warm",6,"I flew Singapore to Jakarta on 28 June. It was an early morning flight. The cabin crew was professional and working hard on this flight to get the meal service underway and completed despite the short flight duration. The seat felt a little cramped. The food was a slight disappointment and the service was less friendly or warm than what has to come to be expected of such a premium airline. Having said that, the crew was careful in ensuring that the pre-arrival checks are properly carried out (seat belts secured, etc) and that the safety of the passengers are paramount as should be the case.","Skytrax"
2016-07-31,"I felt dissatisfied and disappointed",4,"Flew Sydney to Amsterdam, returning from Paris to Sydney, both via Singapore in July. I had researched Premium Economy with SIA. The flight on A380 tended to be more comfortable with more room. Boarding in Sydney was chaotic and confusing. The A350 seat to Amsterdam was very uncomfortable (front row) and the foot rest was redundant - I am 188 cm tall and this seat is not designed for my build by any means. Service was generally good but not up to the marketing hype. Only offered champagne once on each leg despite the way it is marketed and if I wanted more if was begrudgingly offered. Food (Book the Cook) was okay. Considering cost and advertising this as a premium cabin, there was no sense of privacy or a little bit more exclusivity because rarely, if ever, were dividing curtains or wall dividers closed. This was more for the convenience of FA who were moving between Premium and Economy with food trolleys, etc. Many Economy pax took the opportunity to wander through cabin, especially when nursing crying babies. Also, noise, especially many screaming babies were immediately behind my rear row seat in A380 flights - very noisy (even with noise cancelling headphones). Certainly there was more room and a little more comfort but at what cost - I don't feel it was anywhere near value for money. My biggest concern and complaint, which I made to FA, and even to SIA customer service, on CDG to SIN flight (July 15), was when parents left their two boys in Premium Economy while they took themselves off to Business class. They did check a few times but basically the two boys were left to their own devices. I had to stop them from damaging the lights, the window shutters, clambering over their seats, especially the young boy of 4-5 years. The FA cannot be expected to keep an eye on two young boys and neither should passengers. In this day and age, this is a big concern. Anything could have happened to the boys. What if there was an emergency - who would look after them? They became very restless and eventually I complained to FA but nothing was done. The parents were inconsiderate, selfish and irresponsible. Singapore Airlines were disrespectful of other paying pax. As a passenger, why should anyone's flight be disrupted and stressful due to others' selfishness as in this case? This is not about whatever class your in; airlines must stop parents from abandoning their children like this for everyone's sake. Also, if anything happened to the children, who is liable - the other passengers? the airline? Would I fly SIA Premium Economy again - I seriously doubt it. It has potential but if they don't deliver on their marketing promises, I will fly other airlines who do. Also it is disappointing that they cannot even respond to a written complaint. If you over-promise and under deliver consistently, you have dissatisfied customers. This was over 4 flights and I felt dissatisfied and disappointed overall.","Skytrax"
2016-07-30,"frequent drinks brought around",9,"Barcelona to Sao Paulo. First flight with Singapore Airlines and I was interested to see if travelling with Singapore would be substantially different to the experiences I had with AA/BA.  I flew economy but the service in economy with Singapore Airlines was equal to that in business class on AA. The Boeing 777 has a 3-3-3 layout so a bit more spacious for those in economy. We had the bassinet seats at the front as I was travelling with my wife and 3 month old daughter. Food was great, frequent drinks brought around as were snacks and fruit. In flight entertainment great.","Skytrax"
2016-07-30,"service  is anything but premium",4,"Not so much (if at all) Premium. I flew with Singapore Airlines from Singapore to Melbourne (29/07/2016) in Premium Economy as part of a return trip to Colombo. This was my first time flying Premium Economy with Singapore Airlines, though I have flown it before with another large Asian carrier (which was a good experience). I usually fly economy with my partner for holidays and business class for work trips, so have some sense of the competition and product on offer. I'm also tall (194cm) and fairly broad which can make fitting into standard economy seats a squeeze. I had read a few reviews before the flight (all positive) about the new Premium Economy offering from Singapore Airlines and was interested to see for myself. The boarding at Changi was surprisingly disorganised and something of a circus. There was also some delays with take off which appeared to put the staff into such a fluster they forgot to give us menus or the standard amenity pack. The seats in Premium Economy look modern and fancy but are surprisingly uncomfortable for tall people. While they provide a bit more leg room and recline it is hard to make much use of this in a comfortable manner, and forget about getting much sleep. The foot rest offers nothing other than an annoyance and a reduction of leg room. The staff were (on the positive side) not rude but generally unhelpful, unfriendly, looked bored and appeared to go out of their way to not offer anything that might be perceived as an extra (eg. another glass of wine, a second cup of coffee, authentic hospitality etc). The main meal was very small and surprisingly un-tasty. The snack before landing was meant to be chicken fried rice but I struggled within the minuscule dish to find anything other than white rice and a couple of bits of carrot. The meals were so small and mean I was starving by the end of the 7.5 hour flight. The wine/champagne (if you're very lucky you can get one glass) they serve in a plastic tumbler (unlike the ad). The staff also have a habit of leaving you locked in with your empty meal tray for about an hour, which I can only imagine is a crowd control exercise. The entertainment system was good with a reasonable range of titles though annoying compulsory ads at the start of each viewing. It has an bad habit of switching itself on while you are trying to sleep as the controls are right where your knee pushes into the side of the seat. Overall, Singapore PE appeared to me to be a very average Economy with a slightly fancier looking seat, though not one that is well designed or practical for taller people. The service is anything but premium, in fact I've had better service in standard economy for a whole lot less dollars. My experience was nothing like the reviews I have read.","Skytrax"
2016-07-28,"an above average business class",8,"Manila - Denpasar via Singapore. Out of MNL via a very, very old B772ER with the very, very old recliner seats with pull out screens in a 2-3-2 configuration. Singapore Airlines should retire or refit this plane soon. I don't think it's fair that they charge premium price for such an aged regional bird. Despite the trademark efficient, if not cold, SQ style service and tasty in-flight catering, very little can justify premium SQ pricing. The recliners are not a big issue on the short 3.5 hour flight and can actually be quite comfortable for a quick snooze after the meal service, but the screen is prone to glare, and my wife's screen was just malfunctioning the whole trip, making her experience not much different from a recent J class experience on a shorter MNL-HKG trip on PR with no IFE save for borrowed iPads. There wasn't the standard stowage space you'd expect from more modern J class products, but the toilets were clean and the amenities plentiful. So disappointed on this leg. Onward journey from SIN to DPS on a more modern A330 with angled-lie flat seats and a 15 inch seatback IFE AVOD system. Better product with more stowage areas. Service was half a degree warmer than the crew's from the MNL leg, but still a bit robotic for me. Got the nasi lemak via Book the Cook for breakfast and was quite a tasty offering. Less drink runs this time, but it's a shorter flight. All in all, an above average business class experience, but SQ needs to up its game a bit more for the price they charge.","Skytrax"
2016-07-25,"it is an average experience",5,"Bangkok to Singapore. My IFE unit screen was not working as the screen went fuzzy and shaky when turned on. The FA tried to restart my system but it did not fix it. As no other seat was available, I was struck with no movie entertainment except for the music for the whole flight. Crew on this flight of the Singapore Airlines standard. They did the usual greeting when boarding, pre-flight drink and hot towel. Hot Towel is something not many airlines offer. Bangkok is not one of the country where you can book the cook, but the foods were not too bad with a Thai dessert on the tray. The cabin is clean even though this is relatively old plane. That might explain why the guy 2 rows in front of me also has the same problem with the IFE unit. Overall, it is an average experience.","Skytrax"
2016-07-24,"enjoyed our business class experience",10,"First time we flew Singapore Airlines Business Class from Singapore to Sydney and return. Outbound boarding was on time. But soon after pushed back, the aircraft returned to its parking position due to electrical problem, resulting in one hour delay. Upon took-off all passengers who sat in business class asked the cabin crew to convert our seats to bed mode because it was an after midnight flight. We slept for about 5 hours and were woken up by the FA for breakfast, whereas our daughter was left sleep until half an hour before landing in Sydney. The meals were tasty and glasses were filled up frequently. FA were friendly, except one stewardess looked not so interested in serving us. We landed in Sydney only 20 minutes behind schedule. Inbound flight : Check in process went very fast and served by a friendly ground staff. Boarding was also on time. The cabin crew were friendlier compared with their compatriots in our outbound flight. However, we couldn't sleep/rest due to turbulence weather which we experienced almost the entire journey. All in all we really enjoyed our business class experience with Singapore Airlines.","Skytrax"

Boarding was fast and FA's greeted everyone by the family name. Pre takeoff drinks was served when we were settled down. Flight was smooth and food was yummy as I preordered under ""My cook"". Wine was offered throughout the meal service. Entertainment is good and the seat even though it is not the latest biz class seat but it is good size. Landed on Singapore on time. For those that transit in Singapore via Singapore Airlines, don't forget to claim your Changi Voucher of S$20 for general retailer and S$20 for liquor, tobacco per passenger. That's S$40 off liquor if you buy in the airport Duty Free Shopping. Singapore Silverkris Lounge is great. I like the space and the food. Love the TWG Tea selection - Singapore Airlines really know how to pamper their passengers. We freshened ourselves up and had coffee and snack before time to board our connecting to BKK. This A333 was a old bird but still in working condition. The FA was really thoughtful to offer cold towel when my partner jokingly mentioned towel should be cold in the reallty warm cabin while she was giving out hot towel. The temperature quickly came down when we were at cruising height. The food out from Singapore on Singapore Airlines is so much better. Flight was delayed a little due to air traffic in Bangkok. Overall, I love the Singapore Airlines Biz Class .","Skytrax"

I asked for earphones from three different flight attendants but was only given one when I typed my request on my iPad. The food was nothing spectacular. The ground crew on my flight from Singapore to Delhi insisted that I have my backpack checked in and argued that it was too big. I have used the same bag on my flights with KLM and Emirates and they allowed me to carry it inflight. I have high regards before with this airline but sadly their service has gone downhill.","Skytrax"

As I have allergies I have been given the same chicken breast with carrots etc. After hearing that I have been bringing my own food on board to eat. This crew made their own version of cup noodles with chicken plus they had mushroom soup for me because I mentioned about NZ and CX flights where they made protein shake and chicken soup for me (not on the menu). It's these small little things that can make one happy. Thank you Singapore Airlines. Wish they had wi-fi on board.","Skytrax"

Terribly disappointed at the inflight service, quality and quantity of food offered (and I don't have a large appetite) plus the age of the aircrafts. SQ tickets are not cheap and not having travelled with SQ in a while, I was so looking forward to my flight given the inflight service reputation which in my opinion has gone to the ""dogs"".  Aircraft was old and used my wet towel to clean the tray table and mess. No bar service - just a round of juice, beer and sparkling wine before the meal, which was a beyond belief. Hot casserole and bread and nothing else - not even salad or dessert. Asked the steward for bottle water and was told they only offered tank water.  I said I don't drink tank water and he brought me a small bottle from BC. Breakfast was a terrible meal too. On the return one round of Bar service provided this time. Same story with bottle water request and cabin staff brought me a few extra sealed cups of water off other pax trays.  Again, horrible breakfast with a hard cold muffin and a poor fruit salad.

2016-07-18,"not be using them in the future",3,"Perth to Zurich return via Singapore. I booked my flight through a flight partner (Virgin Australia) and before this trip I didn't know how flight partners worked, all it did was give me a headache. I wanted to book in my seats, normally you can do that online, however I was unable to do so either through Virgin's website nor through Singapore Airline's. I called Virgin and they told me I need to speak with Singapore. I called Singapore and requested seats. That worked fine. However on the flight over I didn't realise that sitting right at the back was so noisy, I wore earplugs the whole flight and could still hear the noise, but that was fine, I learned my lesson, but when breakfast came, I was the very last person to be served they ran out of the edible meals and the other meal was some kind of fish (which smelled too strong for a confined space). I normally am one to enjoy all kinds of basic airplane food and am really not fussy, but this was too much. Fish for breakfast? I actually was really unhappy because I never got a choice. Knowing all of this, I decided to change my flight home seat booking, so I wasn't the last person on the plane right down the back near all the noise. I emailed Singapore airlines with the request as soon as I landed. It took a couple weeks until they responded with a stock email saying I need to contact Virgin. I emailed back saying Virgin cannot do this as they dont have access to the seating plan, it is Singapore's job and I know as I have done it before. The email response that returned was the same stock email as they had sent again. This time I was really angry and re-iterated that they should please read the content of my email. Third time and I received the same exact response again. This was now 1 month after my original request (lucky I was away for 6 weeks). I had to find a way to call them while overseas (which was a who other headache) because this was not being resolved online. So I called them and had a very long difficult conversation trying to get the guy to help me as he really wasn't actually listening to what I needed and I was getting frustrated. He finally put in the request for me to get the seats changed and when I told him about the food last time he said he could also request a no seafood meal. So I thought great, I'll do that. On my flight home, the seats were all good but this time I discovered that requesting a non seafood meal means that they dont give you any option at all whatsoever, you just get the eggs, even when the meals being served are chicken or beef with no seafood options! When I asked if I get to choose the normal menu as it already is non seafood, I got an abrupt response about taking the meal from someone else. Gosh I had no idea about all this rubbish. So I learned a lot of things this flight. That Singapore Airlines have terrible online support and rubbish food and no matter what I did it didn't get better. I hear all these great things about Singapore Airlines and its probably fine if things are going ok for you but when they go wrong, they dont help you, not without a lot of effort and frustration any way. I will not be using them if I can help it, in the future. FYI I was going to make a complaint to them on their own site but after going through all I did with their online support last time I feel like its pointless and I am probably wasting my time as no one reads the emails (I can assume).","Skytrax"
2016-07-17,"not as good as I expected",6,"London to Melbourne via Singapore. In general, the boarding process and on-board service was very good, with most flight attendants being amiable and chatty. The food was good too, apart from a very ordinary entree leaving London. However, both flights were marred by very noisy children. On the first sector (on the very quiet A380) I was in the front cabin which offers a more intimate setting. A small baby cried almost all of the trip despite attempts by his parents to pacify him. So a decent sleep was impossible. Even the supplied noise-cancelling headsets could not eliminate all of the noise, and anyway they produced a constant repetitive buzzing noise. I fully support family travel and do feel for parents who have to deal with distressed children but surely SIA could arrange for a quiet area for travellers. The sector to Melbourne was worse. I was seated in the front row of the small front cabin - with 2 rows of seats and no bassinet places. Behind me was a family of 5 with a girly toddler who screamed for most of the flight. A baby crying I can understand, but this family was generally very noisy and seemed unaware that they were sharing the cabin with other passengers. There seemed to be no attempt by cabin staff to try to improve the situation, even though their exchanged looks indicated that they were aware of the noise. Added to that, the cabins of the un-upgraded B777-300ER's are becoming quite shabby and worn, and the IFE systems are behind the times. Because of the noisy fellow travellers I have to downgrade my ratings for these flights. It is a pity, because SIA are reliable, honour seat allocations and the staff are generally very good. Maybe I was unlucky, but my trip home was not as good as I expected.","Skytrax"

Flight over was good, check in was quick and boarding fairly organized and FAs were attentive from PER. Flew A380 from SIN to CDG and the plane looked tired and there was a film of dust on pretty much every surface - would expect more from a high end carrier like this. Meal service was quite slow, and FAs didn't bother to ask me if I wanted a drink, just breezed past me. Meal collection was also slow - 1 hour to collect trays. Most of the FAs seemed unconcerned with their passengers. Food was OK. Exit Row seats were good, and worth the extra $. MUN-SIN: different story, plane, a 777 appeared cleaner and newer, and FAs were attentive. Sitting not even halfway through the plane, couldn't get my first meal choice on either Dinner or Breakfast. Exit row seats not worth it - cart kept banging into my partner's leg/tv screen as the config of the aisle makes there be a little ""turn"". Window seat on this exit row also has a restricted leg room due to protruding of the exit door. Singapore should rethink this config and do 2-3-2 for the bulkhead to make a bit more space. SIN-PER, FAs attentive, but still meal service was quite slow. IFE on way over seemed good, on the 777 on the way back, new KrisWorld system kept freezing for everyone in my row. Touch screen wouldn't work, then remote, then touch screen. Selection of movies quite broad but TV series lacked a bit of punch. All in all, not a bad trip but if I could fly cheaper on another reputable airline for these destinations, I'd try them out.","Skytrax"

The planes are getting old and quality depends on the type of planes. The newest A350 is equally horrible as the cabin space in economy is tightly squeezed to optimise seats for $, but missed out on comfort. The soft touches of SIA being premium such as haagen daaz ice cream, food menus, biz class toiletries pouch or previous-palatable local food in economy have been discarded for margins and this is where I feel SIA have lost their direction/plot. Flying SIA is no longer an experience of delight. One finds too many issues and only is contented to reach the destination safely.","Skytrax"

I was made to believe that Singapore Airlines offered great service however I was unimpressed. Food was average, drinks sparse and you had to ask and wait for a while for them to return with a drink. Some of the flight attendants had no warmth or smile. You would think on long sectors, there would be more attention to service however this was not the case. Overall, disappointing on SQ and would think twice before booking again.","Skytrax"

I was surprised that the dinner menu was not provided - rather the cabin crew took the ""chicken or fish"" approach. Not sure if Singapore has ditched the menu for economy class. Food was ok, but seems like they switched to cheaper looking cutlery this year. Also I found the cabin light was inadequate. Again not sure, if it was intentionally kept dim or just the the aircraft was aging. Overall, I felt a bit short of the 5 star service that I am used to getting from SQ. I hope this is an one off experience.","Skytrax"

I think the slogan was 'Singapore girl, what a great way to fly'. Nowadays if you are lucky enough to be in business you will still come across one of these amazing women. However, you are more likely to get the totally uncommitted new fleet of cabin crew in economy who view the public as a bit of a nuisance and eye contact has gone. Tragedy that whoever is in charge of training cabin staff for this airline is doing a terrible job and losing loyal customers. On my flight, SQ217, Singapore to Melbourne, 10.45 on July 7, I had a rude male steward ever who did not smile once. Back to Qantas for this frequent Australia to Europe passenger.","Skytrax"

On this red-eye flight, there used to be a warm meat wrap and breakfast with main meal, yogurt, crackers, fruit slices and roll and butter. This time, the wrap turned into a cold curry bread, tasted really cheap for sure, and breakfast only contained cheap fruit slices with main meal. FAs also forgot to hand cutleries in to passengers.

My husband sitting beside me was served quickly but for some reason I was left waiting on both meal times. He had nearly finished before I was attended to. When the meals arrived (dinner and breakfast) they were the worst I have had on a flight. The seats are quite comfortable and you have privacy the way it is set out.

2016-06-17,"the crew, they were fantastic",5,"Saved by the crew. Very excited to be flying Singapore Airlines business class but sadly the reality fell a little short of the expectation. Yes, the seats are massively wide and the leather is lovely but it all feels a little, old in comparison to what's on offer with the Middle Eastern carriers. No turn down service (flight left Melbourne at 1835hrs) though a nice warm doona provided. The seat only has a thin foam pad as an underlay when turned down. Meals were served when they determined, not you. I say ""meals"" though for some reason there was nothing offered coming into Singapore although the menu showed a snack available. I used ""book the cook"" and the fish was sublime but the remainder of the meal was nothing too exciting. There is no toiletry bag though SQ pride themselves on having hand creams and lotions etc in the toilets. Which is fine but we all love a take away from a flight, surely we should be given a choice? Also, no pj's! These days it's just expected. The Silver Kris inflight was pretty poor, limited number of first run (decent) movies, I ended up watching some videos on my iPad. The screen size was quite small in comparison to other aircraft I've been on in J class. But the crew, they were fantastic. Friendly, professional, efficient, calling me by my name every time. 110% to them. Am returning to Melbourne on the A380 in about 10 days, I hope I can give a better account of my return.","Skytrax"

I am also aware of passengers who had been waiting at the airport for more than 12 hours and did not receive any notification from the airline about the cancellation until the last minute. Moreover, despite trying for hours to call their hotline, I was perpetually put on hold. This was also the experience of other passengers. Ground staff refused to open their check-in counters to assist with our enquiries until 9.40pm and even then they were late by 20-30 minutes. Can you imagine the feeling of confusion and uncertainty when the airline was not contactable over the phone or on the ground to tell us whether the flight was delayed or cancelled. I have since written in to the airlines customer service and more than a week has elapsed without any reply or explanation - mirroring the complete disregard for their passengers they displayed during the cancellation.","Skytrax"
2016-05-29,"service and staff were excellent",7,"First time on Singapore Airlines Premium Economy from Sydney to Paris via Singapore and as usual with SQ the service and staff were excellent. Boarding in Sydney was well-handled with no pre-take off drink offered. Seated in front row 31A and B with screen on the wall. Food served promptly with drinks offered and juice or water brought around during the flight. Landed in Singapore on time and spent the transit in SQ 1st Class lounge due to Virgin Australia FF Status. Flight to Paris left at 10 past midnight and boarding was a little chaotic with no-one really taking notice of which lane they were supposed to be in. Seated in 33 H and K for the long flight to Paris and noticeably less leg-room than the front row. Cabin was only half-full so some people moved to vacant rows, however due to seat design they couldn't really stretch out. Which comes to my only complaint which is the design of the seats. They would possibly rank as the most uncomfortable airline seats I have ever sat in. They are too short in the squab (where you sit) and the leg rest is almost useless. I would hazard a guess that some seats in economy are more comfortable. Overall if you have only ever flown economy you would probably appreciate the slightly extra leg room and the bigger screens but overall I would save up and fly business class. The other thing with the A380 is you can't rest your head and pillow on the cabin wall as there is quite a gap between the two.","Skytrax"

2016-05-20,"treat passengers quite well",8,"Tokyo Narita to Los Angeles with Singapore Airlines (SQ12). A380 on the upper level Business Class section. Service on Singapore Airlines is top notch, staff are very friendly and professional and treat passengers quite well. Food and drinks selections are excellent with a wide range of choices available. Having flown on several A380's primarily those operated by Singapore Airlines, I have found that this one offers some of the older seating which I am not terribly fond of. My problem with the seats is that the foot rest shelf is offset and does not allow for one to site with their legs straight ahead, instead you have to angle your legs slightly which is uncomfortable. Also on these older planes, the electrical controls for the seats are showing their age and heavy use by being slow to respond or not respond at all. For converting your seat into a bed, there is unfortunately no information provided and either requires you to spend a great deal of time figuring it out or waiting for an attendant to help you (or watch them while they help someone else). Basically the latch to release the seat back is located on the upper outer edge towards the aisle, but is well concealed so not easy to find even by touch. You must also make sure that the seat is in the full upright position before trying to convert it to a bed. Another problem that I have encountered is that the temperature in the cabins is usually on the warm side which makes it difficult to sleep well. With regards to inflight WiFi, it would be nice if this was included for Business Class and Suites passengers considering the cost of tickets on Singapore Airlines. Overall though I greatly enjoy taking this flight from Narita to LAX since the A380 is quite comfortable and less prone to the effects of turbulence.","Skytrax"

There is no overhead locker space for 35A as the partition wall blocks the cabin bins, while 31A has a single storage pocket on the bulkhead, stuffed with magazines etc, rather than the double pockets on the seat backs. I utilised the Book-The-Cook service on all legs, which were nice meals but nothing to really to separate them from regular inflight meals in terms of presentation. The seats were nice and comfortable with excellent width, recline and nice leg rest. The big bonus was the generous 13.3"" screen size which was clear and wonderful for watching the IFE. However the high wall mounted screens in row 31 meant that any movie I watched or personal photographs I wanted to view, they would be on view to the whole cabin. Whilst seated in 35A, I could clearly watch what was on the screen of the person in 31K for example. The staff were super attentive as they always are on an SQ flight. The only hassle was the Auxiliary Power Unit failing on the SYD-SIN leg which meant that there was no AC boarding the flight and a prolonged wait to depart the the flight at Changi Airport.","Skytrax"

The business class cabin was full of children. I had booked the flight 1 week prior and opted for the afternoon flight as the reservations agent had told me it was almost empty. I understand loads can change, but if I had known I would have opted for the evening flight even though this would have allowed only about 1 hour 30 minutes in Changi before catching the connecting flight. The food was inedible - my specially selected chef inspired meal of Tasmanian salmon was dry, with rubbery beans and overcooked pasta. The breakfast served just before landing in Milan was awful - two rubbery and cold poached eggs. There is no business class amenity kit provided - how cheap can an airline get? It just smacks of miserliness. I sent a formal complaint to Singapore Airlines and their lukewarm reponse was to say sorry. It is simply not good enough. Frankly, this airline has dramatically slipped. It can no longer be considered a top tier airline. The only saving grace is the personnel, who are exceptional. The business class lounge staff and most of the flight attendants were absolutely wonderful. However, this is not enough to redeem this airline. I take 3-4 long haul trips between Australia and Europe per year and will never fly Singapore Airlines again!","Skytrax"

Long-haul is never pleasant, so anything that goes towards alleviating the pain is most welcome.

My only problems were the seat was kind of small for my size but that what you get for flying economy, the in-flight entertainment had a good selection of movies but the screen I felt wasn't clear in this day and age where HD is supreme and lastly the meal was smaller then I remember on my last Singapore Airlines flight 10 years ago.

When I queried them on this change upon my arrival in Paris, they sat on my query and took more than two months to reply with a respond that doesn't shed much details on what went wrong. It has been 87 days and I am still awaiting a satisfactory response. Having endured an unpleasant flight and getting no clarification on what happened has made me feel like the airline doesn't value or care about the interests of their Economy Class passengers. Given their relatively higher fares even for Economy Class, I would urge customers to think twice if they are intending to fly Economy Class with the airline.","Skytrax"

Smooth, steady and quiet in the air, a beautiful looking plane especially the signature long and curvy wings and rather cool batman-looking cockpit window. Leg space is larger than other economy class.  Noisy wheel box and luggage compartment mechanisms (on both flights so it's not a coincidence).  Insufficient aisle clearance as you pass through premium economy cabin so we had to literally hand carry our hand carry luggages at that stretch of the aisle. Noticed that cabin crew was struggling to find space to put hand carry bags into the overhead compartments.

Food, IFE, crew etc. were fine (though nothing exceptional) but the seating was a big let-down. With a 1x2x1 configuration, each seat is absurdly wide, which does not make for comfort - with only one armrest usable, the other side requires a pile of cushions as a substitute. The beds do not flatten electronically, and need folding down by hand, a rather cumbersome procedure. When flat the bed is not particularly comfortable, with a small off-set ""cubby hole"" for one's feet. Furthermore, the overall feel of the cabin was pretty tired; I don't know how old this particular aircraft was, but Singapore Airlines started flying A380's in 2007, and this one was showing its age.

Onboard, cabin staff are fantastic, and throughout the flight maintain a visible presence, coming around multiple times during lights out with drinks or snacks for anyone who is awake. The food is tasty, three options for lunch/dinner and two for breakfast, and both the menu cards and metal cutlery are welcome touches. Planes comfortable and clean. The A380 is wonderfully quiet, but the seat comfort and IFE system on the Boeing B777 is actually superior and I'd pick the latter given a choice of aircraft. IFE superb with a wide variety of films. Amenities in economy is quite basic compared to some other airlines (socks, toothbrush, pillow, blanket).

Two minor differences: no more headphones but airphones and no drinking glasses on the meal tray but plastic cups. In fact I like the airphones which suppress the airplane noise a bit more. Plastic cups not really an issue but I prefer glass. More importantly: they still serve the cotton hot towels which is a real pleasure. Legroom was decent and the meals were delicious and nice presented. Service on the Amsterdam-Singapore leg and vice versa was of a very high level and consistent. I really appreciate the hard working cabin crew, nothing is too much trouble to ask for. When you push the service button an attendant comes to you generally within twenty seconds. What really surprises me is that they do not forget anything. When I asked for an extra bread or drink during the busy meal services they always came back to satisfy me. I have done this quite a few times and was never disappointed. Very different from my experience with other airlines. Unfortunately the cabin crew on the Singapore-Perth leg and vice versa were a little less attentive. Still good but not exceptional. Meal services took a bit longer and I think this is due to less crew than on SIA's long haul flights. I am happy with this airline and would like to fly in their new A350.

Told them that the number could not get through and the response that I got was they can't do anything. Tried calling the number again the next morning, same situation, voicemail. Finally, in the afternoon they called me back and said they have located my luggage and is on its way. I got my luggage the next day at nite. Is more than 30 hours. No apology offered by them.

On this flight of almost 4 hours they offered a full meal with the choice of European/international or Asian/local fare - plus a menu card. The food and the wine were tasty, got one or even two refills and felt fine . Arrival ahead of schedule, swift procedures.

Seat width very large and about 1.5x bigger than BA's offering on their A380. Seat turned over to create a proper bed with white cotton sheet and duvet and two pillows. TV big and movies were the usual Hollywood classics and recent releases. Dinner was superb - chicken satay canapé followed by crab salad and then duck rice for main with a dessert and fruit / cheese platter to follow. Where BA had the edge over Singapore was in the wine and champagne selection - BA offering 4 champagnes over Singapore's mere one champagne (Tattingger 2007). Also Singapore gave no amenity bag and instead gave the standard economy class sock, eye shade and slippers - I've had better amenity kit in economy in Qatar Airways, Vietnam Airlines, BA to name a few. The magazine selection was poor as well with no suitable magazines for men under 35 years like myself. Service was tip top with attention on tap and lots of pleasing to my requests for their fine TWG tea selection. All in all a much better seat than BA given Singapore do a 1-2-1 config on business vs BA cramped 2-3-2. Would choose Singapore Airlines again so long as price was similar to BA.","Skytrax"

If they had put us on the side of the row we could have helped each other and not try to convince a strange man who cannot understand you or is asleep to let you up.

Staff were friendly, the meals ordered using book the chef were great and the champagne which is poured on request is a nice touch. The seat itself is comfortable with very good leg room I did expect more recline and given the length of time Singapore Airlines waited to introduce premium economy, I expected more. To put this in context I think their economy class  is a very high quality product. The new IFE was excellent with a wide range of programs to keep you entertained.

There was a special transfer desk in the terminal, and the guy manning it was really friendly. On to the flight itself, my seat was very comfortable and food was of sizable portions and tasty. Krisworld was a joy to use and there were many video and audio options. The flight attendants were the key to a good flight, as they were so attentive, coming around offering snacks and drinks throughout the flight. They also responded to requests promptly. My only peeve was that the couple in front recline their seat all the way the whole time, including during meal times, or throw your blankets under your seat so that it eats up the space of the passenger behind you.

First of all, we were very disappointed with the seat. It may well be the broadest business class seat amongst the airlines but it is very hard to sit on. I felt very uncomfortable after 5 minutes. Singapore Airlines have obviously spent a lot of money installing leather seats but they have seriously overlooked the comfort factor. If you're travelling with a loved one the new 'pods' do not permit easy communication. Secondly, you have to make the seat into a bed yourself. This approach is just not good enough. For example, on Air New Zealand the crew ask you when you'd like to lie down and make your bed up for you. The service was just average. I asked for a 2nd cup of coffee with my breakfast on 2 occasions but this request was ignored. Overall, I was not impressed with Singapore Airlines and did not get my money's worth.","Skytrax"

From priority boarding as a business class traveller and getting a pre-flight drink as soon as you get seated is always a good start to your flight. The service provided during meal times was good and had no problems with not having my preferred option. Food and drink overall was great. As for the fold out bed I found it too narrow and not quite long enough. But I still managed a comfortable rest. The bathroom amenities were very good and had exactly what I needed. One thing that leaves me with a good impression is the fact the crew are very willing and clearly enjoy what they are doing. I would recommend.

2015-12-08,"disappointing set of experiences",5,"Perth to Tokyo Narita via Singapore. Having flown SQ fairly regularly over the past 20 years it is interesting to see a decline in economy class, most particularly its lack of crew consistency. SQ used to be my favourite for its crew consistency in service and courtesy. Sadly, I notice it declining every year the past five or so. Check-in at Perth by snobbish and cold DNata staff quite a difference from past experiences. Perth to SIN was not bad on the older 777-200, not completely full so had a spare seat between myself and the window passenger. Legroom was good on these older jets, with an older entertainment system, which I tend not to use that much. The food was fairly dire for economy and portion sizes terribly small compared to the past. Why is the choice always a bland beef or fish (even when labelled the 'Asian' dish)? Singapore is a nation with a rich culinary tradition, but the meals were invariably bland and uninteresting on all four flights. Choosing the Hindu non-veg meals on the return journey to was more a fraction more spice, but again miniscule portions. But worse was the robotic and occasionally sullen crew. Not once on the PER-SIN did I see the inflight supervisor smile the many times he was in economy class. Just haughty and stiff. Upon disembarking, he couldn't even raise a smile for the economy class passengers. Apart from two very junior staff (about 1-2 months on the job, I asked them), who were pleasant and helpful and actually bothered to make eye contact, the rest of the crew I saw in economy were none of that. Mainly robotic, courteous but practically no eye contact and a cold efficiency. TYO-SIN was a dreadful red-eye special at the rear of a packed Boeing 777-300ER. A noisier plane more claustrophobic feeling large jet I have not encountered down the back. It was unpleasant for a nearly 7 hours in darkness. The leg room is just passable. The entertainment system was the only saving grace for those who enjoy it late at night. Food again was ordinary and bland and small portions. Drink service was stingy. I became visibly ill during the flight and whilst crew members saw me using a sick back and using the toilets repeatedly, did not once ask if I needed anything. Mostly the crew sat down at the back around the galleys gossiping in the interval between meal services. They worked fairly hard during service, but there was no warmth for passengers. On both flights, the time taken to clear the meal trays is now long, nearly one and a half hours on both flights. Unconscionable on a past-midnight flight when the majority of passengers generally wish to sleep.  For the passenger who remembers their finer years, I will no longer give them preference when considering my options from PER to TYO. A really disappointing set of experiences.","Skytrax"

San Francisco to Hong Kong via Singapore and both crews were unfriendly - they only smiled and chatted when they were together preparing meals. They seemed badly trained - meal time was a debacle - instead of pushing cart, they seemed to be taking trays here and there. By the time I received my meal, it was cold - they never came and offered extra drinks, tea/coffee. Took ages to clear trays - in fact passengers were returning trays to meal area. When kids cried, there were no crew trying to help in any way - they were hidden most of the time. They found it very hard to smile! Their training seems to have declined - it's not just important enough to look after the business section, people in economy used to be treated well too. The food is as bad as the US airlines and now the crew is behaving like the crew on US airlines. I find it sad that I will have to try and find another airline. My daughter in law flew from Singapore to Geneva and Zurich to Singapore and she struggled with her 11 month old till she complained to the supervisor and then they changed the attitude! Really, is that what we all have to do? Singapore Airlines needs to get back the charm and friendliness it once possessed.  I hope when I return to the US I will find a big improvement in crew.

Singapore Airlines say they had to change the aircraft and so the aircraft we were put into had no Premium Economy seats. It seems to me it was easier to put on us another aircraft and apologise rather than find an aircraft with the appropriate class seats. There were others on our flight who were downgraded like us. Given the segment was from Singapore to London - it was coming from their hub. I find it hard to imagine that they didn't know in advance they were doing this and at the very least to offer a refund. Instead we were pulled aside as we were getting on the plane (despite having boarding passes with Premium Economy allocated seats) and offered an upgrade voucher for another flight (from Economy to Premium Economy). We could not use the upgrade voucher as we are not in a position to travel long distance in the next year before it would expire. It would also have meant we would have had to fly from Melbourne to Singapore to use this voucher - and then pay to fly all the way back too! I emailed Singapore Airlines 3 times and did not have a satisfactory response - the offer was that we could use the voucher on any segment (I don't think there are many segments longer than Singapore-London, so that would be a win for them) and $500 in travel vouchers for use in the next year with Singapore Airlines - again not practical for us.","Skytrax"

The food was superb, and the service was sensitive and quick. The staff were always on hand to assist my mother. There was only one glitch. Because of our missed connection, Singapore Airlines had re-routed us to fly Singapore to Zurich, from where we would have a British Airways connecting flight to London -  an airline we did not want to fly on, preferring to pay more for the Singapore experience.  Arrival in Zurich was on time at just before 0800. Whilst endeavouring to locate where our next flight left from, Airport staff quickly worked out what had happened, and that we were on their lists as requiring wheelchair access. So we were in the wrong terminal, but the Swiss authorities took good care of us. The transit is easy if you know how. Our onward connection was on British Airways (Zurich to Heathrow) in Business class. The business class seats were so close together and being over 6'4"" tall, we were moved to the front seats. The meal was just sandwiches and drinks, so disappointing for a business class offering. Also, no-one had thought to let us know which terminal we would disembark at. The change was that we arrived at Heathrow T5, and not T2 as expected with SIA. The Heathrow staff were a godsend, finding our luggage (no mean feat) and even trying to track down our rental car, which had already gone to another client due to change of terminal. We felt cheated by this and it reflects poorly on Singapore Airlines to be organising this type of flight substitution.","Skytrax"

But once we boarded the plane, I realized that me and my mother were sitting in a window bassinet seat with the third seat being occupied by an elderly woman with a four month old. The baby in the third seat started crying during takeoff, and it was like that for half of the flight. Also, despite the fact that this plane was only a year old, the seats were already a bit weathered which made you squirm a bit to find a comfortable position. But the food and in flight entertainment was excellent. But even though the selection of movies are good, SQ has stopped giving economy class passengers the adjustable headphones and now gives the iPod style ear phones which are bit painful to wear, and because of that, we had our ears blocked even after we touched down in Singapore. The Singapore to Bangalore leg was much more peaceful since we didn't have a baby next to us, the food was still good but the quantity was less, the entertainment system also wasn't as reactive as on the first flight.","Skytrax"

Check-in was relatively easy as I checked-in online and went straight ahead to internet check-in counter in Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. My baggage was more than allowance (32Kg instead of 30Kg) and the ground staff told me that I won't be charged. Service aboard was also excellent, luckily they have upgraded the aircraft to B777-300ER which is not new but offers better inflight entertainment system and seat features. The cabin crew were present and happy to assist passengers during the flight. There were three meals offered on SQ323, however I found that the meal has been reduced since last time I flew with them on the same route. No cake offered but changed to ice cream. In between snacks were available either offered directly by the crew or set in the galley. Selection of cocktail and mocktail are also offered on economy class. Singapore to Jakarta a short flight about 1 hour and 20 minutes. Cabin crew were pretty in rush to offer the meals, yet still professional. At this time, the aircraft was slightly older (B777-300A) which has older seats but surprisingly more comfortable than newer seats. In a sum, my flight experience for long haul flights from AMS-SGP-CGK have been positive.","Skytrax"

Breakfast was served at about 3am in the morning and there were a few passengers who were annoyed at the prospect of dining in the wee hours. Stewardesses moved along the aisles to provide us with juices and water. Music was sufficient and there were loads of albums in the Entertainment system but there wasn't enough games.

Qatar Airways seat arrangement is similar to Singapore Airlines layout of 1-2-1 but but it is more comfortable to watch the TV as it well positioned in front of your leg and equip with advance IFE systems. There is no business class travel kit provided by Singapore Airlines and it is a 5 Star airline. There is no such problem on Singapore Airlines A380 but the TV screen is 2 inches smaller.","Skytrax"

Plus at breakfast they left me alone for ages, because they forgot my meusli. They were nice, but their service rhythm was way off. Worst of all was that seat. I was in 11K, which meant I was bulkhead, with a seat behind me. The guy in it kept moving about kicking his legs out all the time.

I like the leather covering around most of these seats which adds a touch of class. Very good lunch service and a decent refreshment on the way into Singapore. This is the first time I have seen the flip down flatbed and I prefer this configuration because at least the seat has a comforter and is reasonably soft - flew Cathay recently and found the seat too hard to sleep. The angled sleeping is really a non-issue for me. Singapore to London Heathrow on the new business class. This is slightly better but I did not see a major upgrade - looks a bit more modern with a bigger screen. Same flip down configuration that worked about the same. Two decent meals plus snacks on demand meant that I arrived well fed and refreshed. Slight glitch on Krisworld was the only issue.

The seat is comfortable and equipped with all you need on-board (usb charger, latest generation entertainment system, etc).

2015-09-25,"worst customer service experience",1,"My husband and I flew with Singapore Airlines from Sydney to London via Singapore, with our 9 month old twins and our older son. We purchased an extra ticket for one of our twins to give us extra space. They initially had us all over the flight. Eventually just before boarding they allowed my husband and I to sit together but we lost the extra seat we purchased and they had three babies in a row! This meant it was so cramped none of the babies could sleep and they all ended up screaming for the entire flight (setting each other off), we bought the extra ticket to avoid this scenario. I noted that there were spare bassinets and empty rows elsewhere on the plane so that wasn't the issue. Neither we nor the other parents or surrounding passengers were pleased. Singapore Airlines are trying to do the same thing to us on our upcoming trip on the way home. They are arguing that since one of our infants has a child seat the baby isn't an infant, and can't have a bassinet, therefore since the other twin has a bassinet we can't be seated together. They won't budge, so one parent with have to juggle one baby on their lap somewhere else on the plane, whilst the other parent has the other baby in front of a bassinet. That's apparently more logical to them then just seating us together. So it becomes impossible to sleep, eat or go to the bathroom. We will never fly with Singapore Airlines again. Worst customer service experience ever.","Skytrax"

However, I must admit the cost cutting is very evident, for the quality and quantity of food and beverages.  While food quantity is not too bad, it is way less than what it was in the past. In the amenity kit offered in economy, the least they can do is offer a good toothpaste. Lastly, the staff should offer drinks either before the meals or with meals. If one has ordered a special meal, it is served before everyone else. However the drinks are only served when they come with the trolley to serve the general meals, which can be upto 30 minutes later - by which time the meal is either cold or finished. This was not the case in the past.","Skytrax"

IFE not best and of the older generation - not responsive and bad screen quality. The crew were outstanding and hard working. Generous servings of drinks including Singapore Slings. Sadly their food has taken a very bad turn south. Tiny mains and very uninspired. Food nothing in line with the elaborate and glossy menus handed out.

An astute flight attendant made a call and within minutes the cabin cooled, but it was the same on the legs coming back, just too warm. We tried to get business class but couldn't, so we opted for economy which was otherwise not too bad.

Flight on time, the seats are comfortable with generous leg room, IFE is very modern and the refreshment served on this leg is very generous considering the flight time is only an hour and a half. Even the little touches such as menu cards in Economy and hot towel they give you upon boarding, go a long way in making the travel experience that bit more special.

There is a separate line for boarding premium economy which is good. The seats were 2-4-2 vs 3-4-3 on economy. There are altogether around 6 or 7 rows with a maximum of 48 or 56 in the section. The seats are wider with more leg room and a retractable thigh rest. I did not use this feature much. It has got a bigger seat which is more comfortable. It is not a flat bed similar to business class. The food was good and I know you can order certain special chef prepared meals before boarding on the website. Champagne is available along with wine etc. The entertainment system is a larger screen which I think is either 11 or 13 inch and there are noise cancelling larger headphones available as standard.

Had booked a centre seat on 777 as travelling alone and had checked in on line but reallocated to an aisle next to another passenger at the window. It is difficult for a fellow passenger to get to the aisle without disturbing you if you are asleep. Cabin was full so could not move. My personal preference if for a herringbone layout when traveling alone. Crew on the leg Brisbane to Singapore were somewhat helpful and friendly, less so on the leg to Delhi but both were OK. I asked for a water on board when in the air after having left Brisbane but was told by the crew member that they were going to a ""briefing"" and I would need to wait. It arrived 20 minutes later. Sleeping on both legs was a bit challenging given that the beds are not flat and you do get used to them being so on other carriers. On the 777 the passenger beside me woke me twice trying to get to the bathroom. Asking for help with the A380 bed was met an explanation of how to do and that it was easy rather that actual help and I had to go back to ask again. Entertainment OK but had to rewind to get to the start of the movie and it ""dropped out"" twice on the 777. Sadly, food was not great, my special meal is almost always the same on SG and was overcooked this time. Coffee was good. Wine selection looked good and had a Tattinger and a Chablis with both being very enjoyable. No bubbly offered pre take off on either flight. A380 cabin a bit scuffed around my seat but otherwise interiors were fine. On time arrival and departures. On balance this was my choice to India as Qantas/ Emirates were via Dubai or on a 737 on Jet Airways via Singapore or Air India via Sydney.

SQ861 on 27/6, delayed by around half an hour, but flight crew handled the flight efficiently. Window seat on the A380-800 was slightly wider, more comfortable than other ordinary seats. Cabin crew provided highly professional service throughout the journey and had frequent cabin presence. An incredible range of inflight movies including Asian and international films, with fairly large screens. Inflight meal was above average, though not impressive. Cabin temperature was too cold and more than half of the passengers had put their blankets on.

What started out as a long 2 leg trip, slowly got longer. I then discovered that the boarding had moved gates. No announcement. I discovered it by chance walking past the departure board. Boarding was a joke. People were pushing in, the staff had no control or idea. The new gate was a transfer by bus. Followed by a 50m walk in the rain and up the stairs. The airconditioner on the plane did not work on boarding, we sat for over 30 mins sweating. When it finally took off, it was 4 hrs 20 mins late. This put us in Singapore at 1.45am with a 6 hours wait for the next flight. When we landed, they offered a hotel, 30 mins taxi ride there and 30 mins back.

Except for the idea of flying in an unusually large aircraft, I did not feel anything special during the trip. In the economy section of the A380 there are only 2 toilets given the number of passengers in each section of the aircraft. The toilet I used for the flight CDG-SIN had a clogged wash basin! Food service nothing remarkable, rolls  are very ordinary. The only thing that perked up these meals were the ice cream bars served as dessert. Check in service in Manila for the outbound flights to Paris was good - efficient and courteous. It was the opposite in Paris for the return. The check in staff was rude. The same thing with the security staff who man the line of passengers reporting for check in. They ""manage"" this long line by cutting it up into two and bringing later-arriving passengers to a separate line that, in effect, let's them jump unjustly over passengers who came earlier. This is an irksome experience from an airline that prides itself in being the best. A strong point though on my flights was the inflight entertainment, Krisworld, which offers countless choices.

SQ's lie flat seats - you either like them or you don't. I am in the latter category. Not supportive enough when seated, and too hard and with an odd angled lying position when flat. But this is old news and newer cabins are on their way. Main complaint was that this B777-200ER was a bit tired in terms of ICE (smallish screens with limited movie collection) and WIFI (there wasn't any!). The latter was a particular bugbear for me as the return flight was daytime, I planned to get some work done, but couldn't due to no WIFI connection.

Flight attendants were courteous efficient and professional coming through the cabin frequently with hot towels as well as water/juices to keep passengers hydrated during the 10+ hour flights. They also knew when to leave passengers undisturbed something you don't really see with many carriers. The seating despite being economy class was pretty roomy both flights weren't entirely full so I got some room to stretch out and sleep for a few hours. The only real fly in the ointment was on SQ12 where the aft toilets weren't working. That wasn't too big an issue as the flight wasn't full but I can definitely see where it would be if the plane was chock-a-block packed. All things considered though I really enjoyed the experience on SQ which proves why international carriers especially Asian ones are miles ahead of any U.S. carriers (with the exception of VX and B6).

Flight attendants remain as helpful charming and efficient as ever. Food and wine are excellent down to the after-dinner ice cream. But this old B777 was tired. So much noisier than the A380 we had just been on. After being in premium economy standard economy seats were so tight. Poor tall guy in the seat in front must have found it tough. Even with a free seat in between myself and my wife it was hard getting in and out and a bum in the face is just not a civilised way to travel in my opinion. We really hope Singapore Airlines introduces premium economy and newer aircraft join this route soon! (The airline is scheduled to launch P/E in September). Another letdown was the IFE. Poor choice especially audio. I like to settle down and doze while listening to some relaxing guys. I gave up on both audio and video as the headphones were useless and the white noise too much to hear anything. Improvement required!","Skytrax"

Haven't flown long haul with them for quite a few years but I think it has deteriorated. Seat pitch is too tight for an airline like SQ and the cost cutting in services is apparent with the bottle of water provided gone and wine glasses replaced by plastic and red and white wines now poured from a large bottle instead of the airline sizes they used to provide. I also remembered when flying long haul some years back they actually provided hot chocolate drinks throughout the night which doesn't exist anymore. It just feels a lot more budget than it used to be. In terms of the cabin and plane 773ER had the best IFE and new seats which i think is slightly more comfortable than the ones on the A388 and A333 which had identical seats and IFE but still I regard those seats as being too hard. While the A333 is supposed to be the newest plane at just 2 years old the fact that it's leased and a bridging plane meant that it was fitted with old seats and IFE the same as the A388 which SIA has flown as much as a decade. Service is OK overall but the SYD-SIN leg had a rather less enthusiastic air steward serving my section but I do accept that there are the occasional bad days. Sharp contrast to EK which I have also used during this trip. Seats better legroom better IFE better food better beverages better.","Skytrax"

2015-05-20,"ingapore Airlines customer revie",5,"Travelled on SQ211 on 16 May 2015 Singapore to Sydney in Economy seat 32G. Flight was full mainly connecting passengers coming in from India. Our second (light) meal was served very late almost at the time when the pilot made the announcement for cabin crew to prepare flight for arrival and some passengers including myself were still waiting to be served! It was rather stressful to rush through my meal knowing the plane was arriving soon. Apparently the reason why the second meal was served so late was due to the high volume of special meal requests from the Indian passengers. I am a Kris Flyer Frequent traveller and travel often on the Singapore to Sydney leg and have experienced/observed this problem before where the meals are served later than usual because cabin crew are serving a high volume of special meal requests. Perhaps SIA need to review the management of special meals on future flights where there are many passengers travelling from India to Sydney via Singapore. It will be interesting to ask SIA how they will manage if 90% of the passengers have special meal requests on one flight! So this was quite a let down in service for me. I also have a suspicion that the in flight meals served have become smaller and lighter in portions. Another problem was my seat TV did not have Entertainment on demand! It was most disappointing especially when I was informed while most of the other passengers had Entertainment on demand programs mine was one of the few that did not have it! Surely this type of problem should be noted by cabin crew at the end of its last flight for service maintenance.

Of course I'm tempted to compare them to the Emirates suites and I have to say that overall this is a much more luxurious spacious and comfortable product than Emirates. Minus the shower which I do miss on such a long journey. The suite is on the lower deck which is wider and the sides don't curve in as they do on the upper deck so the suite is very spacious. The leather seat is extremely comfortable and plush and when they convert the suite into a bed which is separate from the seat it's the best bed in the air that I've slept in. All this can be done because the SQ suite is modular where parts move up and down as they convert it from sitting room to bed room. The food and service was excellent as is customary on SQ. I sat in row 3 which is the only row with 3 windows. I like to look out and have as much light as I can so this is important to me.

While on the flight from Brisbane the service was good on the flight to Delhi the hostess was pretty bad in her interpersonal conduct  very poor communication skills overbearing almost irritating. On a late night flight a little courtesy helps a traveller relax but it was surely lacking. Pretty disappointed after all the slick advertising the real experience was shockingly bad. Money badly spent.","Skytrax"

Usually good service but I have found it difficult to understand why they still have some old aircraft's flying routes - it does not represent Singapore well when it has one of the best economies in the world. The frequent flyer programme seems to have been altered also over recent years to make it so much harder to get gold status unless you pay lots more for tickets on economy. Recently I have noticed that they are handing out in-flight earpieces that I have had a bad experience with and dislike. Two flights recently when I used these I could not hear the movie clearly at all despite trying a new set. From then on I ask for the old headpiece sound sets which work well. Surely SIA can provide the best headpieces to go with its 'image'.","Skytrax"

We are frequent Business Class travellers and were extremely disappointed with the service on this airline. The cabin crew were very disorganized although obviously not short of staff. Dinner took a long time to be served. We were not given a sample to taste of the wine we ordered and the wine was poured into a glass in the galley and then brought to our seats without even being put on a tray as were all the drinks such as water tea coffee etc. I woke up early while most passengers were sleeping and the hostess asked me whether I would like breakfast even though we were about 4 hours away from our destination. I agreed but then waited two hours for it to be served. The French toast I ordered was inedible the bread rolls and croissant were cold and hard and the coffee was extremely bitter. The flat beds are uncomfortable and you need the help of the cabin staff to put them up or down. The most disappointing thing was when I reported this to the airline they simply sent back an email saying that ""meals are served two and a half hours before landing"". I'm not sure what the problem was on this particular flight as our other flights on Singapore Airlines were good. The flight was on 7th February from Singapore.","Skytrax"

Even with twice re-booting the IFE was not working. During the time that the IFE was working the screen is so small and the picture so blurred that it became impossible to see the picture. The adjustment of the brightness was also futile. Hello SQ these aircraft's should be retired as they are degrading your brand name and definitely not worth the money we are paying for.

We returned to the check in desk and were told that they were unable to change this as it had been 'blocked' (We feel that we should have been told this when we checked in). We were advised to talk to the transit desk when we arrived in Singapore. On arrival we went to the transit desk the staff were very helpful but we were told that we were still unable to sit together. We had explained that my husband was a very nervous flier. When we got to the departure gate they were able to change our seats. Why could this not have been done earlier and alleviated a lot of stress for us. The breakfast meal was not very nice. Initially we were told there was only one choice which was Singapore carrot cake which we didn't want as did most people sitting near us. We were found an alternative meal which was cold!

My family members share my experience. Consequently the problem is systemic and chronic. The fact that SIA does nothing to improve this demonstrates not only a clear lack of commitment to delivering a seamless enjoyable passenger experience but also a lack of consideration for the flight crew who have to spend so much time unnecessarily dealing with passengers complaints.

If you order a special meal you will be embarrassed to receive it too early when your neighbors have even not received their drinks. The tray-by-tray special meal service takes so much time that those receiving a standard meal have very little time to eat it at least on short flights. In the glory days of Malaysian Airlines (which I almost exclusively flew between 1998 to 2009) somehow they would bring the special and regular meals together so that all passengers were served at the same time.

The usually short refuelling stop in NRT became an overnight 17 hr delay due to Engine problems. Singapore Airlines held us on the plane for over 4 hrs and insisted on serving us the inflight dinner rather than let the passengers disembark. The hotel provided for Economy class was (Nikko Narita) was rather on the run-down side. First and Business where hosted at the local Hilton and another hotel (Did not catch the name). We had a connection to MDC the next morning in Singapore which we missed. That connection only flies every other day so that we had to stay two days in Singapore over Christmas rather than on our vacation. The biggest problem was that no-one on the phone or the ground staff in NRT could provide us with a new itinerary to our destination. To add insult to injury the first phone representative insisted that my flight had taken off as planned even though I had called almost 3 hrs after the delay started. The second one was even worse in first refusing to help at all as he claimed I had deviated from my booked LAX-SIN itinerary. It was only after some complaining that he finally realized that NRT is indeed on the route. Not that he had any further information to offer after that other than saying I would get more information in Singapore. Once finally in Singapore the representative at the gate who was supposed to have our onward information did not and had us wait for another length of time at the transfer desk in Singapore. There finally I was handed the boarding passes to our final destination and hotel vouchers. I am Executive Platinum with American Airlines and have seen my fair share of breakdowns and delays. However without fail an AA representative on the phone has been able to give me my new route/times within minutes of the official announcement of the delay.

Moreover the IFE didn't work in my seat which was very annoying on this long flight. They tried to fix it onboard as well as during the Tokyo layover with no success. Since the flight was full I couldn't change seats. The food though was outstanding.","Skytrax"
2014-12-22,"ingapore Airlines customer revie",5,"I flew from Melbourne to Singapore on a 777. Singapore to Delhi on the A380 and Singapore to Adelaide on the A330. In terms of seat space the oldest one ie the 777 was the most comfortable. I am 1m73 and the Airbus both felt cramped. On the other hand the inflight entertainment on the 777 was pretty poor with scarce visibility of the screen which makes it impossible to read subtitles on foreign films. The IFE on the Airbus was much better. The cabin and toilets were clean and the crew was polite and efficient on all flights. My main complaints are first with the food. I ordered a Lacto-Ovo vegetarian meal which was pretty standard. On all the outbound flights (and I'm not a fussy person) the meals were almost inedible. The other problem is that as they serve the special meals a long time ahead of the normal meals I ended up sitting in an upright position with my tray for over 90 mins not good. On the Airbus the trays are too big for the foldable table and therefore it keeps on sliding it's really annoying. The white wine was also not very good. My second complaint would be with the ground staff. They were particularly unhelpful at check-in in Melbourne. All I wanted was 2 seats together but they made such a big deal of it all and because I had booked under the Virgin Australia flight numbers I couldn't check in online 48hrs prior so that wasn't my fault. Plus on the outbound we only had 1 hr transit and because the flight was delayed we ended up having to run between the 2 terminals with no help from ground staff whatsoever so that was very poor customer service considering the delay was the airline's fault to start with. We did make our connection but it could have been handled a bit better. Overall I am disappointed and didn't find this airline to be that much better than any other ones. Not worth the extra money anyway.","Skytrax"

The cabin was very comfortable especially the lighting. I was lucky enough to board their brand new Boeing 777-300ER. Take off and landing were smooth without much noises.

Having to endure a full service this early in the morning is just cruel torture when passengers would actually would just want the lights to go out and go to sleep. Why not hand out meal vouchers to passengers with plenty of time in transit to eat at a restaurant at SIN airport and then serve only a light snack on the plane after takeoff. Seats in business class look impressive but are unsupportive in the sitting position and too hard and too short when used as a bed. F&B service as well as inflight entertainment were very good. Crew were also doing a good job. Service overall however was slower at the rear end of the business compartment.

In SQ the service and amenities always amaze me a very polite and professional crew and new equipment. The only complaint I have is how they serve the meals in the Economy class. Special Meals like Asian Vegetarian almost begins an hour before the regular meals and passengers on Long Haul Flights need to be sitting with an upright seat for more than 90 minutes with an empty tray in front of them. Aperitifs for Specials Meals are served well after 30 minutes after their meal when the food/drinks cart makes it way.

It was my first time on the Singapore Airlines Airbus A380 in upper deck economy. Boarding was quick and efficient for both sectors having it about 40 minutes before departure and with boarding queues ending quickly. Legroom was excellent (I am 170cm tall). Food on the Beijing sector was delicious however it was not served hot thus making it a little disappointing. Service was great as the crew smiled gracefully during meal service. However a crew forgot to refill my orange juice (She did not have enough orange juice so she told me she was going to get some for me but did not come). The entertainment was spectacular with tons of movies and music. However the movie tends to lag when viewed. So I settled down to listening to music instead. The seats are comfortable but the pillow is too big so I feel they should make it smaller thus having it to use lesser space. The return sector was much better. The crew were more friendly and efficient compared to the Beijing sector. My dad's luggage had some issues so he told me to board the plane first. As I boarded the plane the steward welcomed me warmly and kindly guided me to my seat also helping me to find an available container to store mine and my father's large carry on.

The two things that really set SQ apart are the catering and staff service. This is really excellent food nice drinks and perfect service. Changi airport also remains a nice hub but starts showing its age. However coming back to SQs one cannot deny that the seats and IFE are not on par anymore with big rival Emirates with whom I flew the outbound leg. I actually quite liked the older style seat on the SQ 777-200ER in a 2-2-2 layout which is perfectly fine and even better than Emirates' product on their 777s. But I still do not like the very wide seat in 1-2-1 as can be found on SQ's 77W and A380. The seat is not good for lounging to wide and short for sitting and in order to use the ottoman one must sit diagonally and lacks good support in the back. Also having to stand up in order to convert the seat into a bed (and back) is not practical. The bed is hard and too short for me (I am 192cm). The IFE cannot compete anymore versus what the ME carriers are offering. Smaller screen less choice and most unexplainable: no IFE on offer before take-off while with other carriers one can board early and already enjoy half a movie before boarding taxi and take-off are over.

The previous flights out had been great mainly because the planes were only 3/4 full so everyone could spread out. However the flights back to Australia were jam-packed and sitting there squashed in my seat like the proverbial sardine I came to the realisation of what the airline had in mind when it purchased the A380 and it wasn't my comfort. Further this aircraft seems to be simply a larger version of what was available before so it takes ages to board and disembark as there are so many more people. In the departure lounge those of us in economy were forced to endure cognitive dissonance having to stand in a queue while those in Business and First class were given priority boarding. Can't these people be whisked into the aircraft out of sight? The A330 on the Singapore/Brisbane leg seemed to be quite aged. Further it was freezing. A few things were broken (eg the lid on the rubbish bin in the toilet). This seemed a basic thing to be broken also rather unhygienic. The sinks appeared to be stained. There does not seem to be enough toilets for the numbers of people on the plane. Economy class seating seems to be encased in metal with no padding to soften the blow. When the metal gets cold due to the freezing temperature this metal is decidedly uncomfortable. The thin polyester blankets supplied are barely adequate. They need to be twice as large and several times the tog rating ameliorate the cold. The things the airline boast about - food entertainment service - are all quite good but in the end I would be happier to spend the entire flight lying down in silence in darkness with a warm blanket and perhaps a good book that I can read by the light of my iphone.","Skytrax"

On one flight they shut down the cabin for sleep at 3.30 on a bright sunny afternoon and insisted the window shade be drawn when I would have liked to see out. After that cabin staff disappeared and only offered water twice in the next six hours or so. On two very long flights only one meal and a snack was offered and once it took three quarters of an hour to get a second drink after meal service was over and the aisle was clear. On one flight the air con was set on an extremely high temperature most unpleasant. We paid extra to fly with them on the basis of their reputation for service which was poor. Meal service was slow and the choices of food ran out on two flights. In contrast a one hour flight with a regional airline managed to serve a full meal and two drinks between Manchester and Heathrow so it can be done!","Skytrax"

Sometimes these things happen. However I was sitting in seat 41c. From the start the air conditioning was frightful. A freezing cold breeze blew around all of the passengers near the back of the cabin while the passengers towards the front complained that it was too hot. Also the stench from the toilets was unbearable and seemed to be wafted out of the toilets at regular intervals during the trip. I did not experience this on any of the aircraft's I flew with both to Amsterdam six weeks previously or on the flight home from Singapore to New Zealand. Although spoken to the staff were unwilling to acknowledge that there was something wrong. On the Singapore to NZ part of the trip I also tried to charge my Air iPad but it would not charge on any of the seats near where I was sitting. The steward said there had been difficulties with Apple products. Potential customers need to know this as it could be important to work during a long haul trip.

The flight crew was more attentive than I have experienced at an elegant restaurant! The access to and variety of entertainment (movies and music) exceeded our expectations. The ""little extras"" (such as hot towels at the beginning and end of each flight socks and toothbrushes) were a pleasant and welcome surprise. Overall Singapore Airlines made a grueling 24hr flight much more tolerable! The only criticisms I would offer are the poor leg room (particularly in the middle section) and the location of the security check-in prevented the use of restrooms restaurants and shopping after going through security. We usually check in early enough to ensure there is ample time to handle any issues that could arise and then we use the restrooms/eat/fill water bottles/shop/etc after we are all set for the flight.","Skytrax"

The IFE was ancient but for such a short flight I did not mind it. Food was decent and cabin crew were as efficient and reliable as one should expect from SQ. Had a 6 hour layover in Changi which is without a doubt SQ's best asset. It's an airport beyond compare and would not mind a longer layover. Flight to DEL on the A380 with less than 100 passengers. Cabin crew were very laid back and allowed passengers to move about the cabin. The seats were extremely comfortable and food was excellent. Service calls were answered in record time and while one of the flight attendants was a tad cold one of the lead flight attendants embodied professionalism and warmth which made up for it. IFE kept malfunctioning and the movie kept pausing every 30 seconds or so which was annoying. Besides that one minor issue I would fly SQ again.

The seats on A330 were spacious and comfortable but the table surface is slippery and your meal tray will slide off if you don't hold onto it. This can be prevented by the use of a tablecloth as found in other airlines' business class. The previous passenger's socks were still in the footwell so cabin grooming could use some work.

At least 3 were late to varying degrees. On at least one occasion I suspect the delay was not due to congestion at Da Nang for goodness sake but due to late arrival. Only the first flight seemed a bit superior. That seemed to me to be small differences eg - a decent filled roll as a snack but mainly the staff worked hard all the time and seemed to have a service ethic. The food well - Take the coffee cup the wine glass the tub of water and the roll off the tray and really you are not left with much. Surprisingly the food on the SIN - BKK flight at 1600 hours was much the same as on a long flight. However usually it was a dry entree or a few small pieces of fruit plus in effect a snack box sized meal. The Cebu - SGN flight arriving at around 2030 about 1.5 hours late offered a snack box with 3 small cubes of chicken and a cm deep flavoured rice and perhaps a piece of broccoli - most children eat more. Spirits were not offered on the longer flights although they were available out of view nor wine top ups. A beer amounted to perhaps 80 mls that is 4 pours to the can. A little generosity goes a long way as does the impression of parsimony. Overall much the same as other airlines. The best food was on a Vietnam Air 1.25 hour flight where they managed to serve and clear a good meal. Although Singapore seemed to cope with routine any variation seemed to cause problems. One confirmed flight was rescheduled and a second rescheduled to another with a stopover making it two hours longer. Both were weeks in advance. I don't believe either flight was in fact rescheduled rather I was bumped. In the latter case although I was notified of a rescheduling it was much later that I noticed it was in fact a route change. On the return flight which had been altered some months before I had paid for a preferred seat. This was confirmed that I had the same seat. However in fact on the day I was given a non-preferred seat in the centre. This was drawn to the cabin crews’attention and they informed me they would and did inform the appropriate department as if that helped me at the time. Three weeks later no response. A refund would not even compensate for the relative discomfort. Had that seat not been available I would have taken the day flight on the un-refurbished plane they left us with for a year until they introduce a new plane.","Skytrax"

For reasons we still can't understand at check-in in at MAD Air Europa checked our bags through to SIN only and couldn't issue boarding passes beyond BCN. We had to check in again at BCN which proved a blessing in disguise as SIA impressed us by unprompted noting that our bags weren't checked through to KL and organising that for us. Flight was on time and reasonably comfortable (on 777) crew handled some noisy adjacent passengers well by taking time to circle the cabin rather than going to them directly with our complaint. Food was OK; although obviously partly serviced from Milan with some uninspiring Italian products. Drinks came with good frequency although self-service option overnight especially for water might be better. Back SIN-LHR on A380. Again check-in staff did well readily changing our seat allocation to what we preferred. Flight delayed mostly by re-routing 75 minutes causing some stress over connections in London - no information offered on those at all. Service OK with choice of three meals (against only two outbound). Breakfast could do with better bakery selection but hot choices both OK. Strange that despite the one hour delay it was offered a good 2.5 hours before arrival (ie 3.30 in the morning London time) and in a vary patchy fashion with different parts of the cabin served seemingly at random. IFE worked OK on both flights lots of channels although not everything on them appears on the menus which is confusing. Wifi offered on A380 but pay as you go so no experience of that.

On the return trip because of the change of 'plane outbound I checked on-line and discovered the change so for the second leg SIN- SYD I managed to change my seats to next to emergency door definitely worth paying the extra. As for the seats themselves on the B777 the seats are very hard with not much in the way of cushioning making a bad situation worse.

There was a problem on the route from Singapore to Brisbane in that our seats were in the centre block and for some reason the crew kept missing us first we got no food (they ran out just as they got to us then started serving people around us but not us) and in spite of several attempts to get their attention they ignored us. Eventually my husband had to go down and ask them for food. The stewardess was very apologetic. I also noticed that when seatbelt checks were done on that flight they didn't actually look along our row. I witnessed a couple of people pressing the Call button and getting no response at least for quite a while. On the same flight the entertainment monitors were unreliable. Mine didn't have sound for a while and my son's just stopped working. The other legs of our journey were quite good and I was impressed that our luggage reached our final destination efficiently. I did find the legroom a bit cramped but that was more to do with the pillows and blankets. The main problem on the final leg of our return journey was a child a couple of rows behind us that just cried incessantly for almost 16 hours. Being a night flight we'd hoped to sleep most of the way but the whole section of the plane around the child was kept awake. There seemed to be no bassinets on our flight so no doubt the child had to try to get comfortable sitting on parents lap? The crew were no doubt also affected by the crying but what can anyone do in such a situation?","Skytrax"

Unfortunately it has lost much of its shine and has reduced itself to relying on price advantage to survive the onslaught by more progressive truly international airlines which are more in tune with today's international travellers. Case in point: during my last 2 trips from Melbourne to Singapore and back on First and Business Class 1) Cabin crews lack communication and English language skills most are not able to carry a decent mature conversation. 2) Male crews lack discipline and female crews rushing around like pre-programmed robots without genuine warmth. 3) Filthy leather seats and the lack of general cleanliness show up an ageing tired airline. 4) Second rate food even in First with badly stocked kitchens without essentials such as Soy milk for coffee and fresh chilli sauce for food.

2014-05-16,"ingapore Airlines customer revie",4,"I was very disappointed by the Singapore Airlines business class travel experienced recently. My partner and I flew from Australia to Europe and back with Singapore Airlines three sectors on the A380 and one on a B777. Surprisingly the B777 provided the more comfortable experience despite the lack of a fully flat bed. The seats on the A380 are extremely wide (which was the initial draw card and the reason for spending $1500 more than for Cathay Pacific) but you have to sit in them diagonally to reach the foot rest - this was comfortable for about 5 minutes. The beds in the fully flat position are quite comfortable but unlike other business class seats there is no smooth transition from sitting to lying - you are required to 'make' the bed. When in the bed position there is no comfortable backrest to allow you to sit comfortably - hence the large number of business travellers seen sitting cross-legged in bed throughout the flight! Furthermore the seats are leather but are very worn sometimes damaged and the headrests do not stay in position. There are no individual amenities kits (just an eye mask and some slippers) - a selection of items are available in the toilet cubicles. There are no pyjamas as on some other airlines. The service was highly variable. The worst sector by far was from Singapore to Heathrow. The staff were anything but attentive the bathrooms were unclean and food was dreadful. Garlic bread was cold and rock hard and the ""Book the Cook"" proved to be extremely disappointing. The lobster thermidore was a complete let-down and looked nothing like the pictures posted online by the airline and other travellers. The nut-encrusted veal was unfortunately the toughest and coldest piece of meal I have had on a flight and the ""crust"" was more like a soggy coating. That said the meals that were not pre-ordered were generally of very high quality. The entertainment system was excellent. Having previous travelled in Business Class with Qantas and Cathay Pacific I would not hesitate to return to these two in preference to Singapore Airlines in future.","Skytrax"

The new business seats are excellent but suffer from the requirement to place ones feet in a small pocket to sleep diagonally. If you can get the bulkhead seats do so as this avoids the problem.

For someone with high tolerance in salty food the Chinese dinner meal (rice with pork in gravy) was very salty. Lamb stew served for lunch was undercooked. Choice of meals ran out for both lunch and dinner and entertainment systems were surprisingly outdated (compared to other airlines with touch screen and consoles SIA only had old fashioned consoles). Air stewardesses were decent but not the most helpful or courteous. Having flown SIA and other airlines like Emirates and even budget carriers in recent years I find that the standard of SIA has been poorly maintained and sad to say even though I am a Singaporean who would want to support the main airline of our small country the substandard flight service and appalling customer service I experienced this flight definitely does not live up to the price of its reputation and premium airline tickets.

I found Singapore Airlines still to be a cut above the rest - but not perfect - and wouldn't hesitate to use again. Main leg on way out was on a modern 777 very nice and clearly more space than competition due to 3-3-3 layout - food all good and I can't remember any other carrier proactively offering so many drinks and refills in Economy. However the Singapore to Manila leg (and same coming back) was a much older 777 cabin with mediocre screens etc. Still no complaints as the equivalent leg on Malaysian (comparable due to distance) is on a real shocker of a 737. On way back my video screen was down for the whole flight and the staff asked me to stay behind to speak to the customer service team at Changi for 'compensation' - they gave me some kind of wallet which was a nice touch but not worth waiting behind on an empty plane for. Singapore to London on A380 upstairs - great flight and great space. All 4 flights were delayed which was frustrating but hey not the airlines' fault. Generally - the long haul legs very impressive the shorter flights average but overall far better than any other route to the Philippines. One frustration is security rules at the gate at Changi - confiscating water bought 2 minutes before at the airport which seems excessive.","Skytrax"

Not only did he manage to do this but having done so he realised my bag had already been tagged and sent down the chute so printed a new tag gave me my travel documents then raced off to intercept my bag and re-tag it somewhere in the bowels of T3. Amazing effort (and obviously successful as my bag indeed made it on the right flight). SAS lounge pretty good nice view of the airfield action. Onboard SQ were using the hi-J config A380 with business class taking up the entire upper deck. My window seat was the last row and on it’s own between the rear exit just ahead and the galley just behind. Service was very nice as usual from SQ and again dispelled the myth that they are smiling robots as I had several nice conversations with different members of the crew. Food was a bit of a letdown (seafood and rice dish very bland) but the bed is so good it’s almost too comfortable - I slept so well that I had awful jetlag for a week arriving at 6pm incredibly refreshed left me hideously out of synch with the local time zone.

However the transit in Changi was confusing as it is against convention in the way that arrivals and departures are in the same area and I was trying to find somewhere to go through immigration again which turns out to be at the gate itself. Also the A380's on both trips had a good variety in their IFE despite not being touch screen because the remote controller was not always responsive. I loved the rear economy section on the upper deck of the A380 it was cosy and small meaning less noise and less people knocking against you when you are trying to go to the galley or bathroom.

The 777 is not the most spacious aircraft but never mind at least Singapore Airlines have the brains to stick to a 3x3x3 seating arrangement and do not push it to 3x4x3 like some others such as Air New Zealand do.

Fruit option for meals excellent. Hot towels and regular juice/water supplies much appreciated and the service across the board could not be faulted - the crews seem highly efficient anyway but it helps that there are enough staff for them not to get irritable through needing to work at breakneck pace. We've done this journey with Qantas when they flew Heathrow-Sydney Singapore but switched because a Dubai-Sydney leg is just too long.

I've seen terminal 123 all built and improve their great standards. I have huge admiration for Singapore. But in recent years I feel S Airlines has cut and cut its standards. Sadly they seem to be steadily slipping down in standards as they expand. It used to be easy to contact SA and change bookings add trips etc. But now it's a major hassle to get into contact. The food (I travel economy class) is truly awful. It used to be OK. I don't eat a great deal or care a great deal about food but the stuff served up is inedible! I saw many meals barely touched. The cabin staff are pleasant as always but it's definitely harder for them. The planes were pretty much on time (as usual). On my last trip the particular check-in staff at Sydney were great (our bags were mistagged and they sorted it out well) and I think it reflects their character: I'm sure these people are always good. The ground ticketing staff in Singapore were rather incompetent. I wanted a business class side trip to Indonesia. It took about 4 staff to look into it for half an hour and they said none were available. I went economy anyway and found every seat in business class empty.

My pork dish was excellent with tender pork cubes and vegetables were done right. The rice was a little dry maybe due to overheating. Dessert was bad tasted nothing like mango cream cake. My companion said the chicken tasted good though portions are minuscule. Other than that I asked for 3 cocktails and all of which were honoured. Cabin crew on this leg didn't smile as much understandable due to exhaustion. IFE is a little dated since they used the old IFE but with bigger screens fortunately still AVOD.

The big downside is the new seat / bed. This has been ineptly designed and suffers from several really irritating issues that should have been resolved before it was rolled out. The seat is wide and has no side or lumbar support so whatever position you adopt it is not good for the back and not comfortable. The armrest to one side contains the table and a a small locker. Both are opened by pushing down. As these are exactly where your arm naturally rests they keep popping up which is annoying. When flipped over into bed mode the mattress is very hard. You have to lie at a diagonal angle due to restricted length and this is not comfortable. A further problem is that seat belt when in bed mode is an inertia reel seat belt - it is far too sensitive so if you turn onto your side or at least try too it locks and stops you turning and then you have to stop again very gently pull it out before completing the turn. It is nearly a great seat and bed but suffers from too many basic flaws which could and should have been spotted and resolved by the designer. Disappointing.

The plane on the way to Singapore (the refitted 747) was much more comfortable in my view than the A380. The refitted 747 is not as wide as the 380 the seats seemed to be more comfortable and certainly had better lumbar support. The service was faultless on the way up. The beverage service quite prompt and the inflight meal looked OK. A further snack was served about 1.5 hours prior to landing. The red-eye flight on the way back to Melbourne on the A380 was OK but not great. However the flight left on time the meals and beverage service was efficient and the meal was adequate if nothing special. The seat however was not comfortable - not enough lumbar support and I had back ache for some days afterwards. The blanket provided was of good quality and nice and warm. The crew were efficient as is usual for Singapore Airlines but not very friendly. One of the toilets in the economy cabin was made unavailable for passengers with no explanation as to why. Information given out by 2 crew members about the flight wasn't accurate - they said the arrival time would be 30 minutes earlier than the actual arrival time but in the end we landed on time. However we were kept waiting once we landed and had to stay on the plane at Melbourne airport. Very frustrating after a long flight. However overall having flown with a number of airlines Singapore Airlines is definitely probably one of the better ones. Both the ground staff and the cabin crew are relatively on the ball. There are loads of choices for in-flight entertainment although I wish they would make the headphones more user-friendly and comfortable to wear - after about a couple of hours they hurt my ears and I could not make them short enough to fit comfortably at all.

But I was told that they had run out of lunch and the rude air stewardess walked away without offering anything else. Aren't they supposed to have enough meals for everyone? Even though the air stewardess offered 2 small bags of chips later this still did not make up for it. Light snacks for main meal? I don't think so.","Skytrax"

I have to say that I am quite disappointed with the service and that there has indeed been a decline in SIA's standards in this area. I ordered a special vegetarian oriental meal whilst checking in online. As it was served first our drink orders were not taken. My vegetarian meal came with only a piece of bread and the main meal. It was extremely oily and I had no salad or fruit to go with it. I was also refused a dessert as I was told special meals had their own desserts. I never received anything. I was also never served a drink until I asked the stewardess clearing the trays if I could get one. Even then she said she would get back to me and never did. I also tried to do some inflight shopping but the airline had extremely limited stock of the products in the catalogue. Most of the products were not in stock at all. I think compared to the competitors for this same leg SIA is definitely below average. I would think twice before paying this much when I can get a cheaper flight with better service.","Skytrax"

Nonetheless there was a handful of crew members who whilst polite were rather cold and didn't appear to be interested in going the extra mile. I've noticed this lately on SIA but this was made up by the exceptional service rendered by the rest of the crew. We ordered special meals. Food on the outbound was excellent though our vegetarian meal on the inbound was very bland and not fulfilling at all. IFE selection was mediocre at best. Movie and TV selection was limited and disappointing. This tends to be the case on SIA it's a bit of a hit and miss. Emirates has its act together much better in this area. We got a refurbished 772 which was nice. Legroom was great. However the hard seat cushions made sitting down a bit uncomfortable after a while and ill-placed IFE remotes which were on the armrests. Your legs would keep knocking against the controls. Overall it was an above average flight and I would use SQ again. Though I wouldn't be adamant.

I used points to upgrade and it was a rare experience for me to enjoy J class so was really keen to sample SQ business class. Great sized LCD TV screen brand new cabin on SQ423 wide seats and such a massive sense of space! Amazingly for a post-midnight departure ex Mumbai we were served a full 3 course meal which was lovely but it's almost impossible to sleep on a full stomach. Much more logical to serve a light snack on departure and full breakfast before Singapore surely? The menu didn't indicate this was an option to be requested so I assume no breakfast service was available. The seat in recline position was great and quite comfortable but it was after putting the bed down to try and sleep the discomfort began. A very hard lumpy bed from the various joins and cushions. And the massive belt that pins you to the bed is totally uncomfortable. I felt like I was tied to the bed couldn't turn over couldn't breathe and ended up having to sit back up again. Equals no sleep! So so disappointing. I'm happy to drape a seat belt over me while sleeping I'm not prepared to be tied down! SQ 217 on the SIN-MEL leg was an old version of the 1-2-1 config. Dirty walls worn leather seats small TV drinks placed on the shelf at the front so it was a case of having to undo the seat belt and stretch out to take it.

On an Economy ticket the meal choices were amazing and I even had the chance to order snacks and sandwiches at any point in between meal service. The FT's were helpful and courteous no matter what the problem or request was. There were 2 downsides only. 1) Having to fly via Munich disembark and sit in the airport for 1.5hrs. 2) The individual screens had the movies on a rolling system so you had to wait until its run was over to start watching the film you wanted from the beginning. With all the films at different lengths this meant a lot of planning to get your timings right throughout the 16hr flight. Of course I wanted to sleep as well and due to the chairs being comfortable and the added help of a window seat I was able to get a few hrs.

Service on outward SQ236 BNE-SIN sector reflected many online reviews I had read: zealously attentive but semi-robotic and impersonal. My change of seat at check-in from 14A to 14K obviously threw the pre-flight cabin briefing off its tracks it was not until the third F/A interaction after the seatbelt signs had been turned off in the climb to cruise that the penny dropped that neither my surname nor my gender matched those the crew were using in dealing with me. At times I felt like a participant in a training video or that the crew couldn't wait to get home. That said the inwards SQ235 SIN-BNE return and final sector of a long trip two weeks later was an outstanding contrast with the archetypal Singapore Girl service striking exactly the right note: attentive without being intrusive modulated and moderated without being mechanical and generally more relaxed comfortable and charming. An invitation to be briefed on the seat controls would have been nice – the SQ regional J-boxes being rather unique – but the food drink and Kris-World IFE could not be faulted. My first time changing terminals at SIN too was a pleasantly seamless experience the Silver Kris lounge and its staff set an example to the industry world-wide.","Skytrax"

I'm 6.1"" and my travel companion is 6.3"" and in terms of leg room for us there was not a lot. There is also a foot rest fitted to the back of the seat in front which when raised digs in to your shins. When it's lowered you can stretch your legs out over it but it then digs in to your calf muscles. It's poor design and it does affect comfort somewhat but not to the point of distraction. There were plenty of entertainment options available. Both my partner and I had issues with the IFE on the outbound leg which lasted about 30 minutes but the steward was able to re-boot the system for us eventually. The food was good and plentiful and the service was also excellent. The crew were constantly passing through the cabin handing out water and juice and other drinks were available during the flight from the back of the plane. The flights to and from Bali were on a 777-200 and both were fine. One thing to note we were served curry on the flight to DPS and it was hot. Sinagpore may need to tone down the chilli a little. Return leg from SIN-LHR was on 777-300 and at boarding it didn't look like it would be a full flight. We were in the forward economy cabin and this filled up and most seats were taken. However the rear cabin was virtually empty and people here were quick to take up whole rows to themselves.

Each of the other legs were on dated planes with the older style business seats (not so great). Of particular concern was the Singapore - Brisbane flight where the seat and its surrounds were visibly dirty. My biggest gripe was the Mumbai - Singapore night time flight. Upon boarding the crew handed out menus and asked if I wanted to be disturbed to eat dinner - which I did after the atrocious Mumbai lounge experience (standing room only). Sure enough I fall asleep and wake up when tables are being set for dinner - I request my meal only to be told that they hadn't heated anything for me so I would just have to wait until after they had served everyone else. No offer of a drink or anything from the crew. Being a late night flight the idea of starting dinner 45 minutes after everyone else was not good.

The seat converts to a flat bed and in this position it is fine for sleeping. SIA uses other airlines' lounges in many airports.

Generally there isn't a great deal of movies to choose from and the TV series they offer are rarely complete series only offering a few episodes.

The air hostesses always had a smile on their faces and were very patient and kind. The inflight entertainment was very good too. There was a large selection of movies TV shows and music to watch and listen to. The food was so-so. I did like the deserts but I didn't particularly enjoy the dinner. Our plane was a Boeing 777-300ER from SFO-SIN. It was very clean and the seats and everything were comfortable. Our plane from SIN-DEL was a Boeing 777-200ER an older plane but still the cabin was clean and tidy. Overall a great experience and one I would definitely recommend again.","Skytrax"
2013-06-25,"ingapore Airlines customer revie",6,"SIN-MEL on 777. Chose largely because of the schedule which is good for this route and price which wasn't the cheapest but allowed me to get full Star Alliance points. The lounge in Singapore for Gold Star Alliance is very busy and a bit tired. Was sat at the back of the plane and the main complaint was that it was unbearably hot. Was told that it would cool down after takeoff it did but took a while and in any case the cabin was still uncomfortable warm for the entire flight. This seems to be a theme with all the Singapore Airlines night flights just too hot and uncomfortable in the cabins on overnight flights. The seats are not very comfortable either very hard after a while and the IFE screens were old and looked a bit fuzzy. Toilets were ok and the food was pretty average. The standout was the crew who were very good and provided an excellent service. They are let down by the physical product though and the warm cabins. It's easy for someone to use a blanket in a cool cabin not so easy for those of us who are overheating to escape from that.","Skytrax"
2016-03-17,NA,2,"My wife Anupama ** travelled on Singapore Airlines from Melbourne to Coimbatore last month Feb 2016 and her return trip was booked for Mar.19, 2016. Due to her sudden illness, me and my wife decided that we would change her date of travel since the cold, fever should not be passed on to any other passenger in airlines when she travels on Mar.19, 2016. She visited the doctor and doctor advised her that she would not be fit to travel in the current condition. He also provided a Medical Certificate which was shared to Singapore Airlines 2 days ago. For the past 1 week, I have been following up with Singapore Airlines in 13 10 11 number and my wife has followed up in India #. When my wife approached Singapore Airlines India they have informed her that please contact Singapore Airlines Australia (Melbourne). I have spoken to Rebecca, Naja, Sheela and everyone have told me that you will get a call from concerned team in 24 to 48 Hours. All their 24 & 48 hours are gone and promises/commitment are never met by your team. First Rebecca told me that there might be charges approximately to 407$(AUD) and then in the evening of the same day I was advised 632$(AUD). When I asked your team, as a customer we were worried about other passengers should not get infected during the travel and it's not advisable to travel with illness. But never your team felt for us and they are just behind money asking us to pay fare of 632$ more than one way fare just because we asked for the tickets to be upgraded to Flexi Economy and travel on a different date. Your customer service team have passed on information to me whenever I called but never I received a call back from your concerned team who authorize change of date promised a call back. Is this the service you provide for customers (No call back promise met, No commitment, No Ownership and just behind money). You can very well check your database since August 2000. I have been travelling Singapore Airlines under my name Venkatakrishnan **. In Feb 2014 me and my wife traveled from Bangalore to Melbourne via Singapore. We had problem in the connecting flight from Singapore to Melbourne. When we asked for Veg Food they said that they don't have any, just 1. We made our booking online and we also clearly mentioned that we need only Veg Food. August 2000 Chennai to Sydney. Apr 2002 Sydney to Singapore. Apr 2002 Singapore to California. August 2004 Chennai to Singapore to Los Angeles. Nov 2004 Los Angeles to Singapore to Chennai. Dec 2008 Bangalore to Singapore to Manila. May 2009 Manila to Singapore to Bangalore. July 2013 Bangalore to Singapore to Manila. Nov 2013 Manila to Singapore to Bangalore. Feb 2014 Bangalore to Singapore to Melbourne. I am writing this mail with complete frustration and anger that when money is paid no service has been delivered. I am going to share my feedback and write about your service in my office intranet so that my office (MNC with 180,000 Employees) would consider to book other airlines for all our employees. Why is your team not able to provide any customer service, call back promise, waive off fees for the customers who have been genuinely asking for help, notifying about the problem, considering other co-passenger health and supporting your airlines in all ways. We are ready to pay reasonable charges for the change of date but not as an entire amount that took more than a single fare. At last after seeing this mail, I hope we will get some response from your team with some ownership, accountability and trustworthy to provide us better service and not bitter service. Please advise us on the final charges (Reasonable Fare and not 632$) for change of date as per Flexi Economy and helps us with the request at the earliest. I hope you can help us with our concern on fees and customer service delivered in a better way. As mentioned earlier let this be a reasonable fare and not entire one way fare (632$), that's too much for an upgrade to Flexi Economy.

I finally booked through the reservation line where I was told that I would not be charged the $50 per ticket for not booking online.

I was then told it would be refunded after I completed the trip. I contacted them two times after the flight, but there has been absolutely no response. It is very poor business practice, because I now wonder where they are cheating and cutting other corners if $50 a ticket is a major problem for a refund.

Anyway I finally boarded the flight and as I was very sick (due to 4 people literally attacked me verbally at check-in counter). I forgot my black leather jacket with valuables on seat 37K in flight SQ238 from Melbourne to Singapore on 10 September 2015 which landed at Changi at 4.00 pm local time and within 1 hour I reported my missing jacket but was told that the flight left the terminal and they could not retrieve any item from the aircraft. I was told to do written complaint at my next destination which I did and was told by ground staff at Ahmedabad that it is high likely that I may ever recover it. The question here is who took my jacket except the cleaning staff at Changi Airport who took advantage of blankets to wrap in it. But the airlines denied the claim. Do I want to travel with this dishonest airline again. The answer is NO.","Consumer Affairs"
2015-10-14,NA,2,"Hi. I sent an complaint to you via email on 30 Sep and received an auto-reply to tell me that your customer service will reply within 10 business day. However, totally no reply from you till date. I am very disappointed by your service. I am writing in is to feedback about 3 mistakes made by your services staffs and the miserable experiences I had from you. 2 days ago (28 Sep), I was flying back from HK to SIN by SQ861 with my family. This is my first time flying with SQ with my big family and we all agreed we should choose SQ for all our future trip. However, something unpleasant happened. I discovered my luggage surface was damaged badly (deep scratches on the surface) while I putting it into my car. Therefore, I went back to the SIA information service counter to report the damages and seek for assistance. I spoke to one of the lady staff and she was trying to call the lost and found office to check if I can make report for this case via email due to I had unloaded all my belonging into my car and the whole family is waiting for me at the car park and my young child and old mom was feeling unwell due to tires and hazy air. However, no one pick up the call although she tried to call few times. After that, she asked me to fill in a form and told me will call the security to assist me in this case. I asked the staff if I can bring the security assistant to my car to check and scan the luggage because I had put all my belonging into my car. The 1st mistake your staff made, she said ""YES"" to me. 2nd mistake was made, she asked me to wait for the security assistant near the counter, without telling me and passing the message to her colleague, she went off from the counter. 3rd mistake was when the security assistant came, I told her that the lady told that she will follow me to my car to scan the damaged luggage. The assistant and the rest of the staffs telling me that this is not the process and told me that I have to bring my luggage back to the office. And they all giving me the unpleasant face and the expression that I'm trying to find trouble from them and even raise their voice when talking to me. I told them that I had a young child and an old lady mom with me. I am not able to make them waiting for me at the car park and because of your staff told me that the security assistant is fine to follow me to the car park so I agreed to wait at the information counter. No one willing to listen to my concern and understand my worries at that moment that my family is waiting for me to send them home. I am from banking service line as well. I always make sure and telling my staffs that when a customer encountering a problem, they already in a very miserable situation. Therefore, we shouldn't give customer the wrong direction to add on their worries. Telling customer the right things to do and guide them the right way is always our job and our responsibility. What is our service level agreement? Assist the customer to solve their problem, understand customer's problem and needs, reduce their worries. However, I couldn't find any of the above from your staffs. I hope you really can look into this case seriously and reply my email as I am able to provide the case form filled by your staff and the photo of my damaged luggage. Does that mean I have to prepare to get a new luggage each time I am taking SQ. Do I still can look for your assistance if I am encountering any problem if I choose SQ again?","Consumer Affairs"

2015-09-06,NA,2,"I was visiting Manila (Philippines), travel date 29th of August 2015. Upon the arrival in Manila my baggage was misplaced by the Singapore Airlines. Singapore Airlines had no idea where they have misplaced/lost my baggage. I had to go through a lot of issues. As it was a business trip I had my office important things which were required for my meeting. I just had one baggage which had all my things (office documents, all personal belongings including my ID, CC, DC & also some money etc...). It was a more than 3 days that my baggage went missing & it was delivered after my business meet got over just in the evening of 2nd Sep '15. My LOSS. Inconvenience & very bad experience, mental stress & trauma: I had to live on the same clothes which I was wearing while I traveled for the next 2 days (assuming my baggage will be delivered which the airlines people kept saying). After which I had no choice but to borrow money and buy clothes for the meeting & office purpose. It was just so insulting and stressful. I had a lot of expenses because of the baggage not delivered by you. Expenses which I do not even have the bill e.g. - traveling expenses to the mall etc. & I had to buy a winter wear jacket for the weather conditions --- costing more than 10,000 INR. As this is my business trip to Manila I had gone thru an extreme stressful time and days due to the delay by the Singapore Airlines. I have messages & emails the proof of my follow up with the airlines people till the baggage was delivered. Due to this inconvenience, my visit to Philippines has been a very bad experience and a great trouble attending my business meeting. Please adjudge.

2015-08-20,NA,4,"I had a great trip from SFO to Singapore and even switched flights with no fee. The food, experience, everything was phenomenal. While in Vietnam, however, I had an injury and had to return to the US immediately for medical help. I was able to cancel my old flight and book a new one. I checked one week later and they said the refund for the first flight was being processed and takes up to two weeks. A month later, they said that they contacted the office (in Cambodia -- this later became a common excuse -- it's in a different country, even though we handle all international issues), and suddenly there was not a note saying it was processed. Two weeks later -- no refund. They call headquarters. Someone let someone else know. It's in a different country, blah, blah. This call ended with a PROMISE to call me the next morning with an update. Three days later, and they tell me, once again, they don't know what is wrong, that the supervisor just called headquarters, but was unavailable. After I asked how the supervisor managed to make such a call while too busy to handle my case, suddenly I was on hold again waiting for the supervisor. He also didn't know why, would contact headquarters, blah, blah. I had a complete meltdown before he agreed to do something more (which means just calling me back, not actually resolving the issue). He actually did call me back and the woman handling my case was not at her desk. He promised they would ""try"" and I corrected him, letting him know that it was not a matter of trying, it was a legal policy and they need to do their job. And of course, no one is allowed to give out anyone else's name, and no one has an extension or direct line. I am a pretty logical person (I teach composition and rhetoric at the college level), but I do feel that there is an element of swindling going on here. I have been flat-out lied to multiple times about this refund and its status. If policies are in place for a multi-billion dollar corporation that allow them to earn thousands of dollars for a single ticket, but suddenly those policies aren't upheld when the money is intended to go the other way, there is a problem. I get the impression that due to the extreme amount of hassle and disregard, that perhaps the company has policies that allow it to delay, which would most likely result in the person losing his or her money. I plan to take legal action if this is not resolved, mostly on principle. It's unfortunate that my experience ended this way as I will never take this airline again, despite another planned trip overseas this winter.","Consumer Affairs"
2015-08-14,NA,2,"My name is Fadzil ** and I was on board Flight SQ 226 boarding from Perth Austrailia to Singapore on 11th August 2105. During flight, I happened to be seated away from my family. However, during the flight meal were served by your crews. However, your air stewardess, came to me to inform me that I will be served on a special meal. I had informed her that my meal was supposed to be a Muslim meal. (How special can it be?) She then told me that she will look into this. However, I have been waiting for very long but no meal was served to me until I had noticed that every one around me including my family had finished savouring their meal. Thus, I was extremely angry, with your staff Ms. Pamela and Pauline for not being attentive enough and forget about my meal. Thereby, I had refused to take my meal as I was too angry with the very poor service that your crew had rendered to me. Although, they had asked for apology and offer to serve the late meal, I was so angry that I had refused their offer. Although Mr. Azhar, the overall incharge of your cabin crew came to pacify me, I was rather perturbed by the fact that your staff have shown such sloppiness in the so called ""Service Quality"" (SQ) airline.

2015-07-09,NA,2,"My family and I were traveling with Singapore Airlines SQ 960 from Singapore to Jakarta on June 24, 2015. I have traveled with SQ all my life since I was probably 5 years old (I'm 40 now). The story started when we arrived at GATE 2 @ Changi Terminal 2. We arrived at exactly 12:30 PM and our flight is scheduled for 3:20 PM. The staff at the counter, Ashraf **, told us that he need the credit card that I used for booking. My wife gave him her credit card which she used to pay for the booking. Then he told us that it is not the correct credit card for one of the ticket, my son's ticket, which I found very confusing because my ticket, my wife's, and my son's ticket are all paid with one credit card which is my wife's credit card. I showed him the receipt from the airline and in there it said clearly the digit of my credit card. And the receipt stated that the tickets are all paid with one credit card. He insisted that the number on his computer display wasn't the number of my credit card for my son's ticket. Now, as far as I can remember in the past 10 years I traveled with SQ and never in my experience a staff at the gate asked for the matching credit card. After 5 minutes of debating of what credit card number being used for the booking, he called his superior by the name of Gilli (or Dilli?) I don't remember his first name. Instead of trying to solve this problem, the superior said exactly the same thing: they need an exact credit card in order to issue the boarding pass (Again, in 10 years, this is the first time they asked me for a matching credit card). It's either I provide this or my family and I cannot board the plane. Then, after a heated 10 minutes argument, the superior told me the last 4 digit number of the credit card used for the booking, which he should have told us the very beginning. I quickly recognized the number as my number I used to pay the penalty charge because we changed our departure date. I told the superior that I used my credit card to pay the penalty for the changing date of departure. The original booking was all under my wife's credit card! Without apologizing to us nor comforting us, the superior was still blaming the number of credit cards mishap on us. I said something to him that it's their communication fault. They should've said something about the LAST credit card used for penalty. But Ashraf ** and the superior defended themselves by saying ""We are not ticketing. This information is ticketing only (I don't even know what they're saying)."" Here's when the story became really strange. I saw the superior talking to another staff (a woman) pointing at us and the woman then walked toward us and stood behind us watching our luggages. She was standing next to a really big luggage cart. Her acting was out of the ordinary and we got very suspicious, my wife asked her is there something wrong, why is she looking at my wife all the time. We boarded the plane and landed in Jakarta at 4:50 PM. We were waiting for our luggages for a long time and one small luggage arrived, the other 3 luggages never came out. Someone from Jakarta Airport Baggage Service called my name and told me that our 3 bags are still in Singapore (1 bag arrived in Jakarta). They will be delivered with the next two inbound flights to Jakarta, SQ 964, at 5:22 PM (arriving in Jakarta at 6:09 PM). We are the only passengers on that flight whose bags were left at Changi Airport. I start to believe that my suspicion has becoming real. Either Ashraf ** did it or his superior did it, or they were in cahoot did it on purpose. I guess the female staff was told to transport our luggages to the other flight (Maybe they think it's funny imagining us running around Jakarta Airport looking for our bags after all, it's payback time, right?). And the luggages were not in the next flight but next two flights so we had to wait a long time at the airport for them. The staff at the airport told us they could deliver the bags to our house. Now, our bags finally arrived in front of our apartment lobby at 9:50 PM. Our keys are in one of those bags. We had to wait almost 5 hours to get into our own apartment. My sister in law's medicines are in one of those bags. We went to Singapore to accompany her check-up. The people at Jakarta luggage service and SQ office can't give any explanation to us on why the bags are being left out. Look, we arrived 2+ hours prior departure time. The people on the ground (Jakarta Airport) told us it's unlikely to happen if we check-in 2+ hours prior. Update: I wrote to SQ and they got back at me with something like: ""We're sorry but Ashraf (the gate staff) is new. Please understand that we will give him more training so that this won't happen again."" According to the customer service staff when they investigated the incident, Ashraf was ""panicked"" and caused the mishap of the luggages. This means Ashraff ** aware of this incident, and leave a room for REASONABLE DOUBT that he MIGHT HAVE DONE IT ON PURPOSE (Just as you know, he didn't look ""panicked"", he looked ""vengeful"")! What customer service are you running? You sound like running a two-bit hawker at outskirt of Jakarta. Shameful.","Consumer Affairs"

2015-05-04,NA,4,"This my first experience boarding on Singapore Airline (SQ) on return flight from Jakarta-Melbourne transit via Singapore. The first trip was great. All the crews were very helpful when we only got 20 minutes time and almost late to catch the plane from S'pore as our connecting flight was late for about half an hour. The airport crew rushed us with efficient speed and direction so we could board on time. Unfortunately, during our fly back to Jakarta from S'pore, I had horrific experience with the security officer who was so rude and ignorant. Getting off the SQ from Melbourne on 3 May 2015 at 4.10 p.m we immediately ran to catch our SQ connecting flight as the departure schedule should be on 4.30 pm. We didn't want to miss the plane. I read the information board that the gate has been closed. My colleague frantically sped our sprint to gate F33, feeling exhausted and nervous after such a long flight from Melbourne. We passed the security check and had our boarding pass scanned without much problem. Without second thought we rushed to the entrance door leading to passage for boarding into the aircraft. No stand by officer from SQ was at the door and no body stopped us for entry. We thought ""Oh dear, did we just miss our flight?"" We heard no announcing information and our focus was to catch the plane. So we ran. In front of entrance door to the plane, the stewardess seemed surprise to see us and asked whether we had the boarding pass. We showed it to her and she was trying to call somebody. We waited. Confused. And we saw the plane was empty. We thought ""What happen? Did we board on the wrong plane?"" Unable to reach anyone apparently, the stewardess asked us to proceed to our seat. Another stewardess greeted us, surprise as well. We asked her why the plane was empty. She said it was ok as the others would board soon. We felt something amiss but we just were too damned tired to think. As we sat, this male arrogant officer approached us with stern face and started to get angry at us for boarding the plane while others still waited in the waiting room. He refused to listen to our explanation whatsoever and kept throwing rude words as if we were two retarded women in scarves. He kept repeating over and over again his rude words as if we were too stupid to understand any single word he said. My colleague and I were so offended. We knew now it was not time to board yet but how we should on earth do we know that when nobody directed us? Hello.... The plane should be leaving at 4.30? We did not make this mistake on purpose and we had apologize. But this rude officer was too ignorant. He kept lashing the same words and treated us like we were two criminals. It was so horrific. He could have warn us with less arrogant and rude ways. After all we did not breach the protocol on purpose. If he showed us a bit of understanding, we would totally understand. Should security officers at SQ act that way? He was so rude and never in my whole life did I experience something like this. This lesson gave me a chill experience and I don't think I would board on the plane anymore. My company should better use other aircraft in catering its employees in travelling overseas.","Consumer Affairs"
2015-04-08,NA,6,"My SQ flight was booked online starting from Jakarta-Sin-Melbourne-Sin-Jakarta. The flight on board was enjoyable with the hard working crews but... The heartache was when I wanted to made a change to the date of the return flight from Sin to Jkt. Online changes is not allowed. Tried calling the Jakarta SQ office, only open on office hour, a costly matter due to endless waiting in queue. Remember it is on an international call. Tried calling SIA 24 hrs office at 2300hr, never get to speak to an operators after holding onto the phone for 15 minutes .

I did but nothing came back. On my 3rd try 30 minutes later: I managed to speak to an operator and get the changes done. This operator is in India. Probably SIA outsource out her operators, SIA reputation is in their hands. This matter was also reported to SIA years ago, my report was still kept with me, the respond from SIA was the same la, probably from a computer... abc... xyz.

After another four days they call and say will replace with identical bag. Then after another few days they deliver a flimsy bag that is not equal to the damaged bag, even the delivery man thought it as too cheap. So, I rejected it, they said they would call. After another six days they called me and told me they would not fix the bag, if I did not want the cheap replacement, that they would offer me cash but not the amount I purchased it. Or they would return my damaged luggage and I could submit a claim and perhaps get my money back sometime in the future. So essentially they wasted 3 weeks of my trip to tell me to file a claim. The representative on the phone was a bit rude and impolite as well. It is really sad that a great airline has such poor service when dealing with damaged bags. Most international travelers do not have three weeks plus to deal with this customer circus. I am still optimistic that sq will fix this problem. People fly sq for the service. If sq has terrible service why choose sq? I paid a lot more to fly sq airline. In the future, I am not sure I will make the same choice. Sq airline your customers deserve better.","Consumer Affairs"
2015-01-13,NA,2,"I recently tried to book a flight on Singapore Air with my 9 month old baby. SQ charged me USD900 and an infant rate of USD1200!! For an infant who doesn't have his own seat and will be sitting on my lap. When I queried this, SQ informed me that they don't offer discounted infant rates. They do however offer discounted child rates for children over 2. So in effect, my 7 year old, who will have a seat, can fly for USD700. I would have to pay USD500 MORE for the privilege of having an infant on my lap the entire 12 hr flight. Surely there is no justification for these fares? I have checked on 4 different Airlines and not one came back with an amount of more than USD200 for an infant. In fact some airline only charge the airport taxes.

Firstly, during my transfer in Singapore airport, a ground crew mentioned that they didn't have time to transfer my luggage. Thus, they left my luggage in Singapore which was due to fly in the next flight which is only going to fly the next day and the same time. The ground crew mentioned as soon as I arrived in Dubai I could ask Singapore Airlines to deliver the luggage with different airlines at the same day. I was bound to come in for work the next day so having my luggage at the same time would be ideal. However, when I arrived in Dubai, the lost luggage claim basically could not send the luggage at the same day. They did not at least show that they tried to help me getting my luggage in the same day. The answer is just â€œno, we canâ€™t.â€ I had to spend more than 2 hours in the lost luggage claim. Secondly, my luggage arrived at 1 am on Saturday, Dec 12 which was more than 24 hours after my flight and it was damaged. I had a Polo Classic 29"" luggage which was considerably new and rarely use. Thirdly, the customer service who handled my luggage claim shows no good gesture in coming to terms that will work both ways. Instead, he just giving me options that works conveniently to Singapore airlines instead of me. This is not what I expected from such an airline who claimed to have a good customer service especially when I had an expensive travel on business class. I filed a complaint on my damaged luggage and Singapore airline picked it up and claimed to repair it. A couple of days later, I received an American Tourister bag without any notice before. Singapore Airlines did not give me any notice that they couldn't repair it and didnâ€™t consulted with me if an American Tourister bag as a replacement will be OK for me. The replacement luggage was AED 285 ($70) almost half the price of my Polo luggage. I sent another email conveying my disappointment, and Singapore Airlines claimed that they could not find the brand in Dubai shocking. I requested to be compensated with a luggage that is at least the same price or not far off from my luggage. After weeks of exchanging email, Singapore Airlines basically does not want to accommodate any of my suggestions. Instead the customer service, Mostafa **, basically gave me an ultimatum that I had to choose from one of the options they gave me. His options was: 1. New American tourister bag (sister company of Delsey) plus service recovery voucher 100 SGD (valid for one year). 2. Cash compensation USD 100 (equivalent AED 360). 3. Transfer the case to Jakarta so you can find same quality as your Polo bag. My thoughts on the options: 1. Singapore Airlines did not ask whether an American Tourister bag worth of USD70 is OK for me as a replacement. They practically just wanted me to accept it while I do not want to accept something that worth half of my luggage. The voucher, as we all now, it is useless. I will never use it as I will not fly with Singapore Airlines anymore. 2. I checked in Abu Dhabi Mall that most of the 29"" luggage cost around AED 500. This means if I take the cash amount, I had to get a new luggage with addition AED 150 from my own money and I had to carry my luggage all the way to my hotel. 3. If Singapore Airlines Dubai treated me this way, having the case transferred the case to Jakarta will not make it any different. I would expect to be compensated with cheap luggage and I did not have time to handle this any longer. I just want to be treated fair. I do not know why they do not want to accommodate my request to provide me with a replacement bag that is at least the same price or not far off from my luggage. This is simple. But my experience with Mostafa **, he did not give me any thoughts in accommodating my request, gave me an ultimatum, and treated me to the convenience of Singapore Airlines instead of trying to accommodate any of my request. I have not received any remorse or apology from Mostafa nor Singapore Airlines. This is not expected from Singapore Airlines who is said highly valued in their customer services. This case has not been resolved, if you are in my position which option you are going to take or what action I need to take?","Consumer Affairs"
2015-01-10,NA,4,"I was traveling by Singapore Airlines by their flight no. SQ1 from San Francisco to Hong Kong on 04-01-2015 and from Hong Kong to Singapore by flight SQ863 on 05-01-2015, and from Singapore to Kolkata by SQ 516 on 05-01-2015. At San Francisco, the direction was to through my luggage from SFO to CCU. On arriving at Kolkata, I did not get my luggage. The matter was reported at the help desk. They asked me to fill up the necessary papers which I did. When I tried contacting the Singapore Airlines, to my utter surprise, the telephone number mentioned in the filled up form given to me does not exist. Everyday, someone or another will call up and ask for description of my luggage and what was inside that. They would say that ""we will call you at 22:00 hours"" and give me a call at midnight to ask me silly questions which has already been answered. Till date, the baggage has not been received.","Consumer Affairs"
2014-12-01,NA,2,"I had my parents come over to Australia from overseas for few weeks. Flight to Australia was flawless however, leaving Australia was just horrible. The check in agent in Brisbane was rude and very inconsiderate. My parents are in their 60s, they have traveled in the past and are not first-time travelers. Despite my mom having a bad knee and my dad possessing a deteriorating ankle, we did not request for special service because they could still walk, we would rather have someone else who really needs the service use it. Prior to their flight, we weighed, checked and re-checked their luggage. I also read the baggage allowance guide in the Singapore Airlines' website to make sure that their luggage complies with the rules. I checked my parents in online prior to arriving at the airport. My parents were entitled to 30 kgs of luggage each so a total of 60kgs for both (and according to SIA's website, luggage must not exceed 32 kgs each). At the airport, one of my parents' luggage was 31 kgs and the other was 29 kgs, the check in agent told my parents that this was unacceptable eventhough both still weighed 60 kgs in total. She would only accept baggage not exceeding 30 kgs each. She told my parents that they either have to pay 1 kg in excess or transfer the 1 kg to the other bag. My parents ended up transferring the 1 kg to the other bag despite the information on SIA's website that must not exceed 32 kgs NOT 30 kgs). My parents were also both entitled to a carry on luggage (7 kgs in weight) with the sum of length, width and height of each piece not exceeding 115 cm. The check in agent totally picked on my parents because she also disallowed the carry on luggage that my parents were carrying at the time because she thinks it was too big, without even measuring it. I have used the same luggage as carry on (both in international and domestic flights) in the past and never had issues. There were other passengers who had luggage bigger than what my parents had. I measured the luggage and the sum was not even 100 cm. It would even fit an Airbus 320's overhead bin. Lucky that my parents had an extra bag, so they removed all the contents of that carry on luggage and transferred everything in their extra bag. What's more ridiculous is that while waiting for boarding, the same check in agent used the airport's intercom to page my parents to report to wherever she was (after customs and immigration) just to make sure that they got rid of their previous carry on. Now, that's what I call power tripping. Didn't she have anything better to do than to bully my parents? Weren't they busy enough? Remember, these are two old people in their 60s, one with a bad knee and the other with an ankle injury. If you do not want yourself or someone you care about be disrespected and discriminated, do not fly this airline. That being said, I will never, for the life of me, fly this airline, nor will any of my family. I will also encourage friends and family to avoid this airline. There are better airlines out there who would treat you and anyone you care about with respect and as equal. This is blatant discrimination.","Consumer Affairs"
2014-11-24,NA,2,"I had one of my worst experiences on SilkAir. I had booked a flight well in advance for my wife, son aged 5 and infant aged 3 months for a meet and assist. For this route, SilkAir is the codeshare flight for â€ª#â€ŽSIAâ€¬. We checked in well ahead for the 8:05pm flight at around 5:00pm. We reminded them of the meet and assist and the lady at the counter who had terrible English (I was amazed at the low quality staff Silk Air has) could not pronounce our destination city and instead asked us to pronounce, seemed slightly clueless and told us to come back to her 15 min before boarding time of 7:15pm. We came at 6:30pm and till 7:30pm kept coming back to her to remind her of the assistance. Each time she kept asking us to wait as they have called someone to come. They never bothered to check with us each time. The lady is CSA Demi at row 4 for SilkAir. The fourth time, a guy from one of the counters (who was spoken to earlier but kept playing on his mobile) and rudely asked us if other passengers are waiting - we could not. We told him about the 3 month infant, and that he was crying for a feed as we kept waiting for the assistance so as not to miss it if my wife went with him for a feed. At 7:40pm when we went and raised an alarm, we were approached by a CSO whose name started with R (can't remember her name), who identified as the manager there. She was rude and unsympathetic and asked me to complain to MI_feedback. She least cared. I asked her it would be ok with us if my wife got time to nurse my son who was crying frantically as the fault was theirs. She said she can't help that. Finally at 7:45pm they arranged a guy who did not seemed equipped to handle passengers. We were shooed away to follow him. When we did he was very rude and had to manage three families. Ours, another lady with a kid and a wheelchair bound person with a large family. He rushed off leaving my wife to fend alone with the kids with multiple bags. My son in the melee fell down and bruised his head as he got scared with all this ruckus and the guy had rushed off with the wheelchair. I went back to complain about this. The CSO was least bothered and then went on to keep the 'closed' signboard, not bothering to hear us. They have pathetic staff at least in this case who're least equipped to handle passengers with sensitivity.","Consumer Affairs"
2014-11-01,NA,2,"I paid for two full price round trip tickets from Melbourne to New Delhi. Missed the first flight due to visa delays and hence flew out a couple of days later on another airlines. I did try to cancel the flight online, but the website would not allow me to. Just found out they cancelled my return flight and the best they will do is give me a credit for a flight that originates from Melbourne! So I am stuck in Delhi and will have to buy two more full price tickets. I will never ever fly with them again.","Consumer Affairs"
2014-09-11,NA,4,"Last month I booked a series of flights from San Francisco USA to Chiang Mai Thailand. I was very conscious of my departure times, connecting flights and layovers when booking this ticket. My eTicket was confirmed and emailed to me and I further managed my booking by adding my personal information (i.e. Passport #, Email, Phone and KrisFlyer Rewards #). I selected my seat and meal preference and printed copies of my itinerary for my records. Now a week before my scheduled departure, I decided to verify my seat selection and have noticed the flight for the final leg of my itinerary has been changed from 9/20 @ 15:15 to 9/21 @ 15:15. I choose my flights very carefully and selected flights that would reach my destination by a specific date and time. I wanted to make sure that I had not made a mistake and verified my correct travel information via confirmation emails from Singapore Air and the agent company who made the ticket purchase. I have called Singapore Airlines US Reservations via 1-800-742-3333 and was informed that I needed to speak to my booking agent regarding any changes. When I explained further that my booking agent has the correct itinerary information and that Singapore Air had the correct information as of 8/10/14. Now For some reason without as much as an email, my final connection flight has changed. The agent I spoke to informed me the original flight I was schedule for may have been changed ""due to a technical issue"". He was very polite but was unable to tell me when or for what reason my itinerary had been changed. I find it completely unacceptable that Singapore Airlines would make these types of changes without concern for their customers needs and travel plans. Now I am forced to endure a 28 hour layover in a foreign countryâ€™s airport and try to reschedule my destination commitments and bookings. I am very disappointed.","Consumer Affairs"

Upon our arrival we found ourselves in the family area as announced by the hostess and there was no information during the online reservation about that. On the connection flight from Singapore to Bali we saw me & my wife cockroaches in the pantry immediately after the food was served. My wife was sick for 4 days and we lost 4 precious days from our vacation. I send an official complaint to Singapore airline website and for more than 10 days we are waiting for the feedback while they announce max 72 hours for a respond.","Consumer Affairs"
2014-03-17,NA,4,"I am writing this to report a very unpleasant experience that my elderly parents had to go through courtesy of the Meet & Assist Service. They got their boarding passes at the Sydney Airport with MAAS stickers on them. I was with them at the time. I personally escorted them as far as I was allowed in Sydney and they could find their way to the gate in Sydney. When the flight landed in Singapore, they were asked to wait till all passengers disembarked. They were then asked to wait outside the Aircraft in the arrivals area till someone comes and picks them up. The whole area got empty, all the Singapore Airlines staff left and they waited for more than half an hour after every one had left. No one came back for them. They then went through a very tense process of walking across T3 looking for ways to get to T2 as their connecting Singapore Airlines flight was from T2. They asked several people on the way. Finally, a good person helped them get on the Sky Train to T2 where the person also helped them identify the gate where they had to go. This was not expected from Singapore Airlines at all and rest assured I will be sharing this experience with my network on Social Media.","Consumer Affairs"
2014-01-16,NA,2,"I was travelling with Singapore Airlines from San Francisco to Kolkata on 2nd Jan. To my utter shock after reaching home, I realize my brand new Nexus 5 cell phone is missing from the case which was packed inside one of my checked in luggage. I contacted the airlines to report the theft and claim the amount. After delaying for 10 days they sent a paragraph from their lines stating they are not liable for goods inside the luggage bag and they advise to not carry valuable items in check in bags. So in case a passenger fails to read the guideline, does it give the airlines the right to open the luggage bag and take out whatever they wish. I feel shocked that such a so-called reputed airline employs thieves who can play around with the trust of customers.","Consumer Affairs"
2013-12-23,NA,2,"I have traveled with Singapore Airlines ONCE and did advise my brother not to travel with them. I had to change my brother's booking as he became ill overseas, contacted Singapore Airlines who assured me everything would be fine. Booking was changed and I was charged for a one-way ticket back to Australia. I was given Numerous excuses as to why I had to pay for a new ticket. In the end, I gave up, I paid via my credit card over the phone. But it did not finish there. I was requested to complete a LETTER OF INDEMNITY FOR CREDIT CARD PAYMENT after all credit card details were given over the phone. (Are Singapore Airlines the ONLY airlines that need LETTER OF INDEMNITY FOR CREDIT CARD PAYMENT?) On this form, they request full name, ID number and copy of ID as well as your address, phone number and email address with all credit card details written out for them and last but not least your signature. This policy of Singapore Airlines is disgusting. A great for internet hackers as they have all your details and copy of your signature to top it off.","Consumer Affairs"

However, when my daughter wanted to check in, she was refused and because her connection there finally succeeded at the last minute to go with the flight as planned.

2013-06-26,NA,2,"Complaint against Silk Air/Singapore Airlines. My ticket details - Onwards: Singapore Airlines - BLR to SIN 15th June 2013, Silk Air - SIN to LOP 16th June 2013, Return: Silk Air LOP to SIN 23rd June 2013, Tiger Airways - SIN to BLR 23rd June 2013. I travel a lot on a lot of flights - Emirates, Qatar Airways, Air Arabia, Air Asia, Tiger Airways, Singapore Airlines, Silk Air, etc. But this was a crazy incident, both onward and return. I traveled from Bangalore to Lombok (Indonesia) via Singapore and back as mentioned above. I did not have a Singapore visa as I was not planning to get down at Singapore. This is the worst experience I have had and would never want to travel Singapore Airlines/Silk Air and will not recommend to anyone. First of all, when I reached Lombok, one of my check-in baggage which was checked in directly from Bangalore did not reach Lombok. (I had totally two checked in luggage, 1 came.) I heard there is a compensation, but no news of when and where I will get it, who will give it, etc. I did not have any clothes. I had to buy everything. And, nobody (concerned Silk Air staff at Lombok) had any clue whether I will get my luggage back or not. The luggage came to my villa resort the next day afternoon (after around 30 hours). Then, when I came back from Lombok to Singapore, they did not do direct check in of luggage to Bangalore. They asked me to do it in Singapore. I was fine with it. They asked me to contact the transfer desk and they will help me out. I went to the transfer desk in Singapore. They told me that I have to get past immigration and check in the luggage. As I did not have a Singapore visa, this was not possible. Hence, I lost my 2 check-in baggage. They told me I cannot take the Tiger Airways flight back to Bangalore as they are aware that I have 2 check-in luggage and that I would have to buy a non-low cost flight which will do check-in of my luggage for me. I told them that my brother is in Singapore (who was traveling with me) and he would take my luggage. Then, they allowed me to travel, without my check-in luggage. They wrote that I do not have any check-in baggage and asked me to sign it. I would like to complain about these two incidents to the concerned heads and also I want to let everyone know about how Singapore Airlines/Silk Air/Tiger Airways staff at Singapore transfer desk treated me. What they should have done: At the time of verification at Bangalore Airport (Singapore Airlines), they asked me for my Singapore visa. I told them that I do not have it as I am not getting out at Singapore. Then they asked me to show the return ticket. I showed them my return ticket from LOP to SIN via Silk Air and SIN to BLR via Tiger Airways. I was let in without any problem. If there was any issue with check-in baggage, they should have notified me then and there itself. Also, at Lombok Airport, they told me to contact the transfer desk at Singapore and the check-in baggage can be transferred. Here, if they had told me that I cannot take check-in baggage without getting out, I would have carried it as hand luggage and would have had no problems at all. (At least, I could have taken one of the luggages as hand luggage.) This was not informed. Also, the staff at Singapore transfer desk was very rude to me. And, whenever I mentioned ""YOU,â€ all the staff was taking it personally. But, when we say ""YOU,â€ we mean the aircraft group and not any one person. They should understand this. This information should be given prior to traveling and not while I am stuck at the airport having no other way than to let my baggage go. What if I was traveling alone? I would have lost my baggage or would have had to buy another flight ticket. What if I did not have money to buy another air ticket? Should I stay at the airport terminal? This is very poor service from Silk Air, Singapore Airlines.","Consumer Affairs"
2012-12-26,NA,2,"My seat on SIA flight from Cape Town to Singapore 58H was torn. I reported it to the supervisor and got only an apology. The only spare seats available were in business class which wasn't an option for SIA to seat me there. I have never seen an aircraft with torn seats on such a long flight. Most budget airplanes fly better planes. The seats were dirty, and Boeing 777 was quite old. The TV screen was tiny and my earphones didn't work. SIA prides themselves saying the average age of their fleet is 6 years. It wasn't the case with this 777. On another trip, SIA changed the time of their departure from Sao Paulo to Barcelona with only a short notice which resulted in me buying another ticket. After speaking to SIA manager, Mr. Neil **, at Sao Paulo airport, I got no understanding as it's part of terms and conditions that airline can change their flight schedule any time. His response was ""Why should SIA pay the cost of changing the ticket?"" Singapore used to be a good airline. With the level of service they provide, it should not be called 5-star airline. It's all profit-orientated which comes at the cost of compromising passengers' comfort and satisfaction. This will be my last travel with SIA. I will post comments about my experience for others to reconsider before booking a flight with SIA. I complained to SIA but never got response. When I called their office in Australia, I was told to contact their office in South Africa and Brazil respectively. I hope someone from SIA reads this and tries to improve their service before losing more frequent travelers like myself.","Consumer Affairs"

She hurt her back quite badly and all we asked for was maybe somewhere where she could lay down or maybe a seat with a spare next to it. They said because we were economy, there was no way they would think about it and this was at the Hong Kong airport. So arriving in Singapore, having a connecting flight, we asked at the Singapore Airlines counter the same thing. They replied, ""Yes, that's fine. But it will be an extra $10,000 for the both of you."" For one, I (the mom) didn't need to lie down. It was only my daughter who nearly cried all the way from Hong Kong to Singapore. Secondly, who has a spare 10 grand!

OMFG! Are you serious? Here's my daughter in absolute pain as she injured her back and no one cared. I will never fly with Singapore Airlines again. The sad thing was I was recommended by so many people that they are amazing. What, because they serve food and drinks? Well they never looked after us and we really needed it. To top off everything, it was her birthday. Very, very, very upset about the whole situation and not only that, it was so embarassing as all the surrounding passengers just kept staring and watching us. Never again.

2012-07-08,NA,2,"My flight, SQ 319, on 28 June 2012 from London to Singapore arrived on 29 June 2012. Due to the very tight connection time (less than 1 hour), we were in a rush to move from Terminal 3 to Terminal 2. I forgot to take my camera bag from the upper compartment (camera and camcorder with our precious family vacation with Europe photos). I just realized this when we arrived in Jakarta. I quickly called my sister who is residing in Singapore. She called SQ and the lady said that they've found them and asked her to go and collect them. She went to collect the items on Monday night, 2 July 2012. Mr. ** from Lost and Found dept. gave her the items which he took from the safety deposit box. The Found Items receipt no. is **. When she checked, the 32G micro chip memory card was missing from the camera. I was so shocked in disbelief. It was stated clearly in the Found Items receipt that there was one 32G micro chip memory card. The photos are worth more than anything. It has all our memory of the Europe vacation for almost 3 weeks in it. How could someone with such a low morale want to ruin other people's life by doing this? The memory card only costs a few dollars. Why is that person doing this? Worst, Mr. ** said that Singapore Airlines is not responsible for the items lost and asked us to report to the police. But the SQ staff already signed the Found Items receipt and they were handed all the items stated in the receipt. Then how come you are not responsible? After I talked to him, then he promised my sister that SQ will investigate this matter in a couple of days. The next day, after trying to call more than 10 times, I finally could talk to Mr. **. He said that ** is on leave today and they are still investigating it. He promised Mr. ** will call me or my sister tomorrow. I even gave him my e-mail address. The next morning, I called SQ again and after so many tries, finally connected to Mr. ** (always take me more than 10 times to call SQ Lost and Found dept. before getting connected). Mr. ** was not as helpful as Mr. ** last night. I said it's supposed to be easy to find who has access to the Safety Deposit Box on the days the items were there. He also said that ** is still on leave today (again?) and promised me that the duty manager will call me in couple of minutes. After waiting for more than four hours, I called again. This time it was a girl who answered the phone and also promised me that the duty manager will call me by today. But until now, there was still no call to me, my sister, not even an email as a courtesy to me. The memory cards cannot be valued with money and it breaks the whole family's hearts to know that all our sweet memories in Europe were stolen by Singapore Airlines, so cold bloodedly. I cried the first time I talked to Mr. **. Any human being will understand my feeling, yet when he is planning to take 2 days leave, he did not assign any of his colleagues to explain the latest situation. I cried every night and couldn't go to sleep feeling with regret. It has been one week and we still do not receive any news about this yet. The longer it takes the smaller chance I'm going to get it back. It is so clear that the person that took the memory card is the one that has access to the Safety Deposit Box. I even told them to tell other staff to return the memory card and I will not pursue this matter any longer. But they did nothing. It is most disappointing that even the duty manager did not try to talk to me or called me regarding this matter. I feel like dealing with the world's lowest, cheapest airlines that don't care about their customer at all! The airlines donâ€™t have any good intention to resolve this matter. We are keeping the Lost Items Found receipt right now with the staff signature on it. If SQ has no good intention in this, we will pursue the matter to all media and to our lawyer.","Consumer Affairs"
2012-06-27,NA,4,"I checked in at Singapore Changi Airport terminal 3 on June 17, 2012 at gate A16. When I boarded the plane SQ878 at 11:50 am, I realized that I left my BlackBerry phone around the waiting area. I notified the SIA staff immediately and they've tried to check with the ground staff and promised to make a report for me for lost phone while the plane is about to take off. One of the staff has also taken my business card and promised to call me and update me about the status. To my disappointment, I heard nothing from SIA while I'm still in overseas. On June 20, 2012, my wife who is in Singapore helped me to make a report to Changi Airport. When I returned from a business trip on June 23, 2012 by SQ877, I immediately checked with the lost and found office at T3. To my surprise, they do not handle item lost at boarding area. My question here is: why is there no clear signboard stating this office only handles items lost in the plane, etc.? So, I was referred to speak to the information counter just outside the arrival hall. Again, the lady staff who is on duty kept telling me, â€œSir, there is no gate A16 in T3,â€ even though I have shown her my boarding ticket. I wonder whether she is a staff at Changi Airport and knows what she is talking about. In the end, I was given no option and have to make a police report at the airport police office. Once again I was given the wrong direction to look for the police post at B3; instead, I found it at B2 with no signboard stating the police post. After few inquiries with airport staff and a young police on duty, I found the office for making a report. During the wait of 30 to 45 minutes outside the office without any air-conditioning, I finally got to speak to the police who is on new shift duty. I donâ€™t know why I was asked to wait for 30 to 45 minutes while I saw the police who is on duty talking to another police from the airport. Why is there only one police on duty and why is there only one computer for making a police report? I reckon that there are many issues which are beyond Singapore Airlines, but the bad experience and inconveniences I have gone through have changed my impression about Singapore Changi Airport and Singapore Airlines.","Consumer Affairs"
2012-06-21,NA,2,"I would like to provide some constructive feedback to Singapore Airlines based on my experience in Sao Paulo, where I arrived on 18th of June and departed on a Lufthansa flight to Munich on 20th of June. I was originally on a TAM flight from Rio to Sao Paulo and from there, I was to take the SQ67 flight (June 19, 01h35). But due to official commitments that kept me longer in Rio, I had to purchase a JOL ticket on a later flight to Sao Paulo instead. The JOL flight was delayed and so I missed my connection to Singapore via Barcelona. I do understand that the primary responsibility lies with JOL. However, I simply want to discuss basic courtesy, politeness, grace and compassion. These are traits that are not legally binding on Singapore Airlines, but are helpful in times of distress. I believe that all passengers should be treated fairly and kindly by all airline staff, regardless of frequent flier status or booking class. However, the important point here is that my office, despite the economic downturn, continues to fly its management staff on business class not solely for comfort during frequent travel. The point is that business class travel is authorized precisely as a contingency for difficult circumstances such as the one that I faced in Sao Paulo to facilitate solutions over missed flights, delays, luggage, etc. Now, the promise of being treated with exclusivity and distinction was made by SQ. As an Elite Gold card member, I wait less for phone service, use exclusive service lanes, etc. and on-board staff are far more solicitous and attentive. In addition to Elite Gold cardholders' expectations of enhanced service, there is also the Singapore Airlines brand. Professionalism, efficiency, comfort, better service. So imagine my surprise when at 2AM at the SQ office in the Sao Paulo airport, Neil **, Station Manager Sao Paulo, treated me with less politeness than expected and told me, ""To be frank with you, it's your fault."" I decided right then that if I would find any solution to my problem, it would not be through him. His only advice was to seek a solution with JOL airlines since Singapore Airlines would not afford me any assistance. Thankfully, the Sao Paulo office is otherwise staffed with a few professionals, who seem to understand the SQ brand and on top of that, are simply good and kind human beings. I would like to commend Mauricio **, customer service agent, who quietly took charge after it was clear that Neil would do nothing further. He escorted me to JOL airlines and helped explain the situation to them in Portuguese, which resulted in JOL's provision of complimentary four nights hotel accommodation and hospitality in Sao Paulo. In addition, he coordinated a search for my luggage (which was, unsurprisingly, delivered by JOL to the wrong place). He provided me a care package with toiletries and all in all, acted with the simple professionalism and courtesy I expected from the beginning. I would also like to commend Argos **, cargo supervisor, who just happened to be at the SQ office the next day, when I returned to try to sort out my flights and rebooking. He welcomed me to the office, offered me a seat and some water, provided use of the office line to call SQ reservations. Simple acts of courtesy and kindness for a stranded passenger, nothing to do with business class or gold card. In the end, my office decided to buy me a new ticket on the Lufthansa flight to Munich. I asked Lufthansa for a business class upgrade and they gave me one. My SQ ticket was then used for my Munich-Singapore leg. Check my KrisFlyer history and you will see that I've been a member since 2001, but that I have been rather inactive until just the start of this year. I have been a Lufthansa Senator for some time now, but I thought to switch to KrisFlyer. I believe that I will return to the airline with the better service. You do not breed brand loyalty, the kind that influences purchasing decisions, without inspiring loyalty. I hope that this feedback will help Singapore Airlines improve its office in Sao Paulo in time for the increased volume of passengers to/from Singapore with the opening of the Singapore High Commission there and influx of investments.","Consumer Affairs"
2012-06-11,NA,2,"I am writing this with such disgust after my experience with Singapore Airlines/Silk Air last night regarding a flight from Langkawi to Singapore (MI369) on June 10, 2012. On checking in with myself and my 3-year-old daughter, we were told that my husband did not have a seat on the plane and would not be allowed on the flight. We had a confirmed ticket printed with us (confirmed Economy, waitlisted Business) and paid full Business class fare. As he is an elite (PPS) flyer, we are guaranteed a seat on the flight-guaranteed reservation in Economy class if waitlisted in first or business class, or Singapore Airlines Suites on Silk Air and Singapore Airlines, as per the website. This is a false claim made by Singapore Airlines as this was not the case yesterday for us. I would be keen to understand options through legal channels based on this. The check-in person refused the above PPS guarantee. Her name was Joslinda ** and during this process, she was extremely rude and laughed at misfortune, finding the whole thing amusing and telling us she didn't have to do anything she didn't want to do and didn't care what anyone on the phone told her. I called Singapore Airlines (in Singapore), at my own expense, to speak to someone in reservations and then put them on the phone to the Silk Air representative at the counter, where she still refused to put him on the plane. This phone call lasted 38 minutes. During this time, I asked to speak to a supervisor in Singapore and was constantly refused by the operator on the phone. No one would do anything as I was being told they had to put him on the plane, but the Silk Air person kept refusing to and the Singapore Airlines representative on the phone basically said she could do nothing more. Zero help from anyone! We asked to speak to the Silk Air supervisor in Langkawi, but were refused as he was praying for an hour. I find this ridiculous that a supervisor would not be available for the only flight on the day. After an hour, the supervisor came down, whose name is Mohammed **. I assumed it was a supervisor, but was not able to tell as he was not wearing a Silk Air uniform or name badge. He refused to make eye contact or speak to us. He grabbed my phone and would not return it to me, until I asked for the tenth time and he then hung up the call. At the last minute, there was a no-show and we were told we were lucky that my husband could now have a seat. This is not acceptable as we had a paid seat on the plane and should have had a seat no matter what. Not because we were now lucky someone didn't show up. On boarding, we also discovered that the Silk Air manager, Mohammed **, was on the flight and had no trouble in getting himself a seat on the plane, at my husband's expense. This was an unacceptable situation and we have still not even been offered an apology by the airline. I will have great pleasure in posting this story to every travel website and travel review service and blog I can find, to share this unacceptable situation and appalling service from Singapore Airlines. As an elite PPS flyer for 8 years (both myself and my husband), this is nothing but disgusting and inappropriate behavior from the airline. It is truly a disgrace that my family were treated so badly by the staff.","Consumer Affairs"
2012-06-11,NA,4,"The ticket was issued on March 7, 2012. Tour agents, Experience Tours Services Pte Ltd. 100 Eu Tong Seng Street Unit 03-1903 Pearls Center Singapore 059812. The flight was to Seoul, Incheon SQ608 on May 30. The trip was organized by the port officer's union for its members. My wife, Florimay ** was issued the ticket paid by me, but was unable to go on the trip as the Korean Embassy refused to issue a visa, as my wife's social visit pass was being renewed at ICA. An appeal was made in writing to ICA if the pass could be expedited, but their reply was they needed 6 weeks to process. The pass was submitted on April 29, 2012 which expires on the 3rd of June 2012. As the return trip from Korea was on the 4th of June, the embassy did not issue the visa unless they could see the renewed pass. I brought this matter to the attention of the travel agent who stated that as the ticket was issued, SIA will not refund the money. Unfortunately, this problem was not intentional. I wish to appeal to SIA to assist in refunding the money spent on the ticket due to unforeseen circumstances. I cannot accept the agent's reply of their inability to help and to which they did nothing. If the reply to my complaint is negative, I will then appeal to the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE). Hope to receive a favorable reply. Thank you.","Consumer Affairs"
2012-05-11,NA,4,"On May 7, 2012, during check-in of my luggage at the check-in counter in LAX Airport, I had showed my handcarried brand-new Epiphone Electric Guitar to check-in staff.

2012-04-25,NA,2,"Safety Breach, Audio Failure, Poor Follow up to Lost Laptop - The first incident was when I was traveling with my companion, Patricia, who required a wheelchair assistance. Opposite us (in the center of the plane) was a large family with a young girl (approximately 3 years old) on the outside aisle seat. Her older brother (about 9 years old) was seated to her left, and beside him was their mother and father. Neither adult was beside the three-year-old to restrain her should she leave her seat. The mother draped a blanket over her head and could not see either of her children. Here's the take-off horror. Singapore Airlines staff were buckled in their take-off seats when the three-year-old girl undid her seat belt and started to run up and down the aisle. The brother did nothing, and neither did the parents. The mother still had the blanket over her head. I shouted at her, and she reluctantly sat down. When the first Singapore staff was visible and walking, I told her of the dangerous take-off incident. She spoke to the mother. She refused to move the child nearer to her. This staff attendant brought a senior staff member (older woman), and again, the woman/mother refused to move the child. Nothing was done; the mother won! I think further pressure should have been exerted on the mother. I am sure Singapore Airlines has a policy for such safety issues and further action should have been taken. The child, listening to all these conversations, became bold and defiant and ran up and down the aisle in front of the attendants, family, and passengers. Singapore Airlines had lost face. The second incident was about the audio failure. Ten minutes into the flight, the section we were sitting in (50K) had audio failure. We could not listen to movies, music, etc. This malfunction was confirmed to us by the flight attendant. So we asked to be moved to other seats. The child was still acting up and out of her seat, and the mother still had the blanket over her head. Now, our audio had failed, and we could not drown out the child with head phones. The attendant agreed to move us further up the plane on the same side as our original seats. The third incident concerns the loss of the laptop. I used the laptop in our new seats and then stored it in the overhead compartment. On arrival in Sydney, we were asked to move back to our original seats, so that Patricia could have her wheelchair sent there. I helped her back. To my frustration, the same three-year-old and her brother were now in our seats and refused to leave them. Passengers were beginning to de-plane (depart), and I was shouting over to their mother to get her children. She ignored me. I was angry and frustrated and could not get any flight attendant's attention. I forgot to go back for my laptop. The children eventually left, and the wheelchair arrived. And again, with all the turmoil and out-of-control children, I walked off the plane without my laptop. I went quickly to bed unaware of my laptop loss. The fourth incident was the lack of Singapore Airlines's response to loss. The next morning (Day 1), I phoned Singapore Airlines Luggage Retrieval in Sydney. They were polite and said they would immediately fax Singapore. I did not hear back from them the same day. We phoned the following day (Day 2) and were told that Singapore had not responded to their fax, and this was 24 hours later. They told us they would fax Singapore again. We waited all day. No response. Now, it's 48 hours later (2 days) and two faxes to Singapore, and still, no responses. On Day 3, I gave up on the number I phoned two days in a row (966-799943) and got passed around Singapore Airlines departments in Sydney. I spoke to a supervisor and finally found out that the computer had not been found. Three days had passed, and no one had contacted us. This is not good customer service from such a large airline that prides itself on customer service. This is why we have chosen to fly Singapore Airlines on many occasions! Six months later, I have just received an email from the Customer Affairs Manager of Singapore Airlines, Sydney. It said 1) there was no recorded incident of the young child running up and down during takeoff or the fact that two air stewards spoke individually and collectively to the mother. I thought any type of safety breach would have to be recorded on a flight. Also, 2) the audio system is now fixed. But it was its failure plus the child running up and down the aisle that made me change seats. And 3) there is no mention of the two faxes sent from Sydney to Singapore and the lack of follow up from lost baggage. This email from the Customer Affairs Manager, Singapore Airlines, Sydney is a polite ""kiss off"" and does not address my desire for compensation.","Consumer Affairs"
2012-04-23,NA,2,"On Friday, 20th of April, I called SIA 62238888 to make flight changes and requests. The passenger with booking confirmation ** requested that the passenger with booking confirmation ** be put on the waitlist on the last to flights, Singapore to Jakarta on April 22. These two booking confirmations were to be combined so that they will fly on the same flight, seated next to each other. All these had been told to the person taking the call and confirmed that request had been made. On Saturday, the passenger with booking confirmation ** called to find out if their waitlist was confirmed. The person receiving the call and attending to this passenger said that no such request has been made. Of course, the passenger called and told me that I did not do what was required from me. That was to make the request to have them on same flight, seated next to each other. I called again this morning and the person on the line said that she could see in her system that this request had been made. My question was what kind of responsible staff do they have manning their call center? We are not taking the bus from Ang Mo Kio to Jurong East, where we can change seats when someone gets off. We are flying your 'prestigious airline. Your call center is messing up passenger requests. That definitely is not why you (SIA) have a call center.

2012-03-11,NA,2,"I took the flight from Brisbane to Shanghai on 25/02/2012 and returned on 10/03/2012. The whole way was accompanied with trouble. Firstly, when I checked in from Brisbane with my 2-month-old son, the man in charge that night told me over 3 times that the baby cannot fly for free, which is not only discrimination but also an insult on us, just because he couldn't find the ticket in the system, which is the problem made by the agent and Singapore Airline themselves. We were waiting in front of the counter over 20 minutes and the baby lying in my arm the whole time, the staff just felt nothing and did not apologize after they found the ticket. Because of that, my good worth AU$6000 supposed to claim tax back, but finally failed because the time was up. The same man called TRS to refuse my claim after I waited over 20 minutes in front of TRS with my baby in my arm because we were the last who haven't boarded the plane. The second we checked in from Singapore to Shanghai, I was told thereâ€™s no bassinet for my 2-month-old son because the staff said the plane only have 4 bassinets and they were all occupied. Also, thereâ€™s no first row seat for us, but the truth was there was no baby in that flight at all, and no baby sitting in the first row at all. I don't know why they lied to me and set me with my 2-month-old baby in the center of the seat without bassinet! The third but not the last, when we checked in Shanghai to Singapore, we were asked to pay the overweight fee, which is $30 per kilo, and we got 10 kilos to pay. The day before we departed from Shanghai, I already asked for an upgrade from 30 kilos to 35 kilos, and was agreed by Singapore Airlines. The note was put in the system, but the staff in the counter didnâ€™t see it at all. They just told me thereâ€™s no notice at all, and if I don't pay the overweight fee, I can't take the flight SQ83. In the end, the time was up and we missed Flight SQ831. When finally they saw the notice, they just asked us to take SQ833, which was nearly 3 hours later. When I asked for the first row in SQ833, they said thereâ€™s no more seat, but they promised to give us 3 seats close to the window with only us 2 people in the 3 seats. But the truth was 3 people sat in those 3 seats. The last thing was, finally, we arrived in Brisbane. We collected none of our 8-piece luggage because we were told the system was broken in Singapore, which made us crazy and speechless for Singapore Airlines. I need the Singapore Airlines reviewed the experience and give us a good response.","Consumer Affairs"

But I was shocked when SIA's counter staff insisted that I need to provide the credit card that has purchased the tickets! I asked her, were my particulars in their system and she said yes, but I can't board all because I wasn't able to provide the credit card numbers to her (she wasn't local I think). She kept on insisting on the credit card no! Everybody was looking at me and my husband as if we were out to cheat SIA! She really made us feel so embarrassed and it's only 6.30 AM! How am I going to get anybody from the travel agency at this time! I provided her with all my credit cards numbers! My husband's! But non fit. We were frantic! At last,1 of my calls was diverted to a mobile phone and the person no doubt sounded very groggy was very helpful. She helped us to speak to the counter girl and also her so called superior. At last, we were given our tickets after their conversation which I don't know what was it all about. My husband told the counter staff, we don't mind either window or aisle seats. That's not the end of my nightmare yet. When I boarded, then I realized, she allocated us 3 to 4 before the end of the plane! Still OK. She placed my husband and me right in the center of the center row! Next to my husband, was a lady whose husband sitting alone by the window seats and they need to bend over through the journey to talk. Next to me was a man whose friend sitting alone too by the window! We thought it might just be pure coincidence or maybe full flight but when I manage to make a quick escape to the washroom because the man also went, then I realized, there were actually a number of empty seats behind! And we are the only fools being put in the center! My poor husband didn't even dare go to the toilet even though he is so urgent because the lady next to him was sleeping and if he goes by my side, it's gonna be very troublesome. If the ground staff was out for revenge, she has done a really good job. Thank you SIA. We were extremely disappointed this time. Other than that, everything was fine. All the crews made our day. And the inflight movies really made my husband forget how urgent he was. As for me, myself, I just made sure I don't drink too much water so I don't need to go to the washroom anymore. Why? The man next to me seems so busy. Either leaning over discuss stuffs with his friend or so busy with his piles of paper work on his lap. We've never had such a miserable trip before.","Consumer Affairs"

However, I would like to point out that this was the worst experience I had in my last 10 years of travel. We boarded the flight at 9:30 and flight took after 45 minutes. We were provided breakfast after 1/1.50 hours of take off which was good and no complains about it. However, lunch was provided before 2 hours landing time at Sydney. This was not as per the norms which an international flight should be provided. We ordered Indian Vegetarian Meals and we were provided only one Vadai, small quantity of vegetables and one Nan/Chapati cut in four pieces. Except these whole tray was empty. There were no fruits, no sweet and no yogurt. Moreover, even after the lunch, there was no ice cream provided to anybody as dessert. Is Airlines saving the cost by providing such inferior services? I would like to know the reason for such type of Services. I would have taken the photo and send to the media which would not only spoil the reputation of the Airlines but would have made worst publicity. The complaint was lodged with various authorities in Singapore Airlines on 19th January and again last week but nobody has tried to contact me except called once last week on Monday that they will send me the response. I am still waiting for official response on the matter. Appreciate your action in the matter.","Consumer Affairs"
2012-01-25,NA,2,"The airline is a mere extension of the police state. It accepts no criticisms just like the government. It is still a government owned company anyway. I am a frequent flyer and had redeemed a round trip ticket to Barcelona before. A cabin crew asked me to sit up straight in a rude way and subsequently provoked harsh verbal response from me, nothing physical or unruly. I have every right to express my condemnation verbally. However, the purser and captain ( I have observed that the airline discriminates against nationality) as well threatened me with detention at security at the airport on the basis of ""vulgarities"". Using harsh language is not a criminal offense. I was asked to apologize to show that I am ""remorseful"", the most self serving behavior you can ever see in a developed country. It is no different to how North Koreans were asked to revere Kim Jong Il. it is a replica of how the government treats dissidents and I am merely exercising my right to express ""dissent"". I view their threats as appalling and defamatory and will be suing them in due course. No customer deserves to be treated in an undignified and heavy-handed way.","Consumer Affairs"
2012-01-22,NA,4,"We feel that we have always been loyal and good advocate consumers of Singapore Airlines. While we have immediate and extended family in Singapore, we have always used Sing Air for over thirteen years now.  Our advocate consumer praises for your airline is such, that friends joke with us, about being goodwill ambassador for your airlines, as well as Singapore the country.  However, our most recent trip to Singapore was humiliating, as well as caused hardship on my husband.  This incident occurred at the Houston, TX airport on December 17, 2011. Our flight number was SQ061, and electric ticket number is 6182119519301 (booking reference PEE7NY). The incident happened around 02:16 as indicated on our luggage stickers.  My husband, son, and I were at the ticket counter, and the Singapore Airlines employees were very pleasant, as usual, and had already issued our boarding passes, and check-in our baggage. At the point we were gathering up all our paperwork, passports, etc., another Sing Air employee walked up from behind the employee assisting us. For some reason, (which was never explained), she had taken my one and only check on, and took it off the conveyor belt down the pathways.  She then proceeded to tell my husband and son that they could only bring one item on board. Which is what they had, they only had one overhead item, and both of them had a computer in a carry case.  Our ticket paperwork, as well as Singapore Air customer service, had said that carrying a computer in a case was allowable, as we have done so many times before.  However, this Singapore employee persisted on telling us that we were only allowed the one carry on bag (which we knew). We are very aware of rules and regulations of both Singapore and domestic flights (we had just gotten off a connecting flight from South Florida to Houston). As we asked the employee when the rules had changed, she just put us off, and said that the flight was full (which it was not, as there were places in economy, where fliers were sleeping across the full three seats. This Sing employee climbed out from behind the counter, and started making commands and pointing to what she wanted of them, which some command were non audible at times, as well.  The Sing employee then asked both my husband and son to check their carry-ons (which had already been accurately weighed as allowed), if they wanted to take their computer.  My husband went on to tell her that he had all his medication on his carry-on. She then told him to get it out of the case, and put it in with his computer. He and my son both were scrambling to not hold up the line behind us, and to our misfortune my husband missed bringing his gout prescription. My husband then asked the woman, why then are women allowed to bring a purse and an overhead carry-on as there is no difference in the number of items (the whole time this was going on, several other Singapore Airline employees were looking at us sympathetically).  One Singapore counter employee had even spoken up, when I was asked again to weigh in my overhead carry-on. This same woman says I should check my carry on also, as it was over the weight. It is then that one of the Sing employees at the counter said that is not over the weight limit for the overhead carry-on. Then, the woman said, ""well, okay go ahead and carry it then"". This employee kept giving us so many unreasonable reasons for these actions. One after the other.  My husband being truly upset having to readjust his medicines, and such, wrote down this employees name. His writing is not actually legible, but from what I can now make of it, the name looks like ""F. Lim"". She was an older Asian woman (actually, she was the only Asian employee dressed in the customer service suits). The remainder of the Singapore Air employees appeared to be American.  After so many reasons this Sing employee gave us, it felt like a personal attack.. We are still disturbed by this experience, and feel that this was selective enforcement. We took photos on our cellphones of several passengers, who had two carry-ons, as well as packages, as we were in the TSA line. The consequences here are that this incident felt like we were being discriminated against, as we are Americans. My Chinese extended family in Singapore agreed that this sounded like discrimination, or, as we felt also, ""selective enforcement"". One of my extended family is a Singapore Airline employee for many years, now working out of the London office. He too was in Singapore for the Christmas family holiday, actually advised us to report this. As Singapore Air wants to know of these incidents, in order to maintain the good image of the company. This incident was not called for, and there is no explanation for this rude treatment in any instance. Another consequence is that my husband now had to miss his dosage of medication. If you are familiar with gout, one of the symptoms are that your toes and foot or feet can swell (not to mention the number of air hours can only add to this). And finally, the last conseqence is a personal one, and that is that we are so disappointed in the one airline we thought was outstanding in this day and time, and that trust is now gone.  As the spring school holiday will quickly approach us this year, we always plan and book well in advance of holidays. Now, we find ourselves in a dilemma, as to what airlines to turn to for our family holidays in the future.","Consumer Affairs"
2011-10-11,NA,2,"I could not remember flying with Silkair in the past 4 years.  My trip from Singapore to Kota Kinabalu on the 10th of September 2011 (Saturday) via MI0392 nevertheless affirmed at least one thing; being a frequent traveler, it was a right decision that I did not choose Silkair. Seated in 21C, I waited patiently for the food to be served by your staff.  Little did I know that on Silkair, being part of a service-excellent airline (Singapore Airlines), racial discrimination is applied to local passengers.  I was puzzled on the rationale of your staff serving passengers in row 22 (Japanese passengers), immediately after serving row 20.  When it was my turn (obviously after the rest have been served), I was left with no choice of menu for breakfast.  So, it was very much a take it or leave it.  Perhaps for that reason, the passenger seated next to me chose not to take the food (caveat: just my assumption).  Later on, minutes after I started my breakfast, I was informed by your staff that there was another pack of food left (if I wanted it), which I have declined. I thought that was just a remote incident of racial discrimination.  For my returning flight on the 12th of September 2011 (Monday) via MI0391, I took seat 25D.  I asked for newspaper but was not given.  I asked for orange juice but it was not served until I had to ask from another stewardess (Chinese).  In the past 2 years, I have been flying at least 20 round trips, mainly for backpacking trips.  I could not believe that the service of your full service airline is far below the standard of any no-frill airlines.","Consumer Affairs"
2011-07-17,NA,2,"STAND YOUR GROUND IF AIRLINE STAFF WANT TO MOVE YOU! I was on flight SQ319   from London to Singapore on 02 July 2011. Ticket number 06185118085576 I had arranged via the internet to sit on an aisle seat (Seat No 50H) due to the fact that I had not been well and was having issues with my health which included leg pains.  I would need to get up many many times during this long flight. On arriving at my seat I was asked/told by the steward that a woman who was pregnant needed my seat as she needed to sit on the aisle because she would have to be getting up constantly.  I said that I had booked the seat due to my health issues. He said ""she is pregnant"". I assumed that the woman was heavily pregnant and had major problems and so reluctantly gave up my pre booked seat. I was placed between two men who intruded on my space constantly. I had to ""push"" the one man off my side and push his leg away from my leg area! Sitting in a position like this was extremely painful and I experienced the most excrutiating leg pains during the whole duration of the flight.  I had to get up many many times just to try and relieve the pain in my legs.  At one stage the pain was so severe that I stood at the back for a very long period of time in tears. I had to constantly get the stewardess to wake the man next to me so that I could get out and stand up before I began to scream with the pain in my legs. Consequently, I never slept for the full duration of the flightall I did was get up, go to the toilet and cry with pain. Through all of this, the ""pregnant"" person slept though  the flight, she drank wine and got up only once during the whole flight! She managed to stretch up and carry her own heavy bags from the hold and appeared quite healthy with absolutely no health issues at all! She was pregnant, ever so slightly and young and healthy! Please bear in mind that pregnancy is not a disease or illness. On the other hand I am 57 years old and was not well at all! Overall this is a very disappointing situation where a flight attendant asked me to be relocated after  I took the initiative to pre-book a seat that would help me cope with my health condition. Something that struck me was that there were many and I mean many men sitting on aisle seatswhy on earth after me telling the steward that I was not well and also after he seeing that I was an older person, did he not ask one of the men to give up their seat??? This has been on my mind and the mind of many of the passengers. I was approached by many of the passengers asking about my condition on the plane once we landed and off the plane. All expressed their surprise that Singapore Airlines allowed something like this to take place! These were people who I do not know! One woman said to me that the young pregnant person"" did not get up more than once during the whole flight! "" She was under the impression that it was a ploy for a better seat. I have been unwell for the couple of days now that I have been back and my legs are not  doing too well. I have a huge swelling at the back of my ankle which is constantly paining. I will approach a doctor this week. I feel very strongly that women should not be asked to give up their seats for young people or for men. Women should not be placed between men unless it is absolutely necessary. And, more than anything else, if one takes the initiative to actually pre-book a seat via the internet then especially it is improper to ask someone of my age to give up that seat for a perfectly healthy young person.  The situation showed extreme lack of good judgment on the part of the Steward. I always fly with Singapore Airlines as I do believe that they are exceptional in their service and conduct! My recent experience certainly has not reflected well on this view.","Consumer Affairs"
2011-07-16,NA,2,"I upgraded my economy ticket to business class at the last moment. I was able to get the ticket via the telelphone talking to the Singapore airlines reservation staff. Once this was accomplished i went to the check-in counter at the Houston airport and was informed that they cannot checkme on business for the whole journey as the Moscow Singapore sector is fully booked for Business class, They gave me a temporary hand written boarding pass and one of their staff people escorted me to the gate. At the gate they tried but were not able to give me a business class boarding pass. They had me a Economy boarding pass stating that they will talk to the airplane staff and make me sit in business till Moscow. Once i am at Moscow, i need to talk to their ground staff there and they will help me with my next boarding. I asked them what about if i do not get a Business class seat at Moscow, will l get compensated for flying like this. They said that if that occurs i need to go and talk to the staff at Singapore once i land there. As i reached Moscow and was about to board, i asked the ground staff about my Business Class boarding pass, and they said ""Business Class fully booked, we cannot do anything, you travel Economy"", they were very limited in their talk too. I again asked what about the compensation and i was told to talk to someone at the Singapore Airport. I managed to fly economy even when i paid business class and reached Singapore. At the airport terminal i approached the local reservation counter and the staff quickly pointed out that this type of issues are not dealt at the airport, i need to go to the singapore airlines office at the airport. This was Sunday, so i waited till monday and reached Singapore airlines office at ION building. When i presented my case, the staff was sympathethic to my situation and were amazed that this could occur, but were not able to help as the ticket was issued from their LA office and i would need to deal with them. She did sent an email to LA staff to call or write to me. Two days passed by and i did not hear anything, i apprached the Singapore office again and they sent an note to LA office. I still did not recieve any feedback. I then called on the US 24 hr reservation line and discussed my case. This meantime i was really pissed off with the whole situation and demanded a full refund of the ticket (about US$11K) The US call center people said that they will look into it and sent a note to LA officicals and they will do the calculations and revert back to me. Meanwhile i conitnued my journey to India. I called the US call center people again and asked for an update, still nothing. Then i receive a phone call that they will refund me US$2200 if i change my complete flight to economy, so basically i fly once sector on Business class, pay US $11k for the ticket and they refund me just 2k if i change back to economy. I said no, i will keep my return journey from singapore to Houston as Business and i want compensation for me flying economy. The statement from them was baffling, ""As i was checked in as Business Class at Houston, i am considered to be flying Business and they cannot compensate for me flying economy from Moscow to Singapore"". Can you believe this? so basically they are saying that it does not matter if i flew economy. I lodged an complaint via their website too and did not recieve any feedback. I am seriously considering to get in touch with my lawyer and see what can be done about this situation. It is appaling. The only good part of the whole situation was dealing with Singapore Airlines staff at Singapore, they understood and they too said that i should be given some compensation, but the LA staff has refused to talk to me directly and have been sending messages via the Call center supervisor.","Consumer Affairs"
2011-01-27,NA,NA,"I would like to let you know about the most terrible ticket issuing experience I have with Singapore Airlines.  I certainly believe that this airline is trying to rip off their customer and keep their money illegally.  I am sure that they have their ways to make excuses and explanation (they name them procedures), but they have had me double pay for three tickets, and have been keeping my money for a month--and not even refunding them in another month. Unfortunately, I have purchased three tickets from Singapore Airlines on 27th of December 2010.  That was my biggest mistake!  It took me three full days and at least 20 phone calls around 20-25 minutes each.  The representatives that I talked to were all helpless and in every problem which comes up, they were always saying that it was the procedure and there is nothing that they can do.  I tried to pay with my international credit card and after two days, I was told that they cannot accept international credit cards. My transaction did not go through and the tickets were not completely approved so the passengers will not be able to fly.  I was told to pay by U.S.-issued credit card, which I had to accept because it was the last minute and these passengers had to fly that day.  The supervisor at L.A. office told me that all three tickets will be refunded in 5 to 13 business days, and he sent me a confirmation about that.  That was on 27th of December, 2010. I did not hear anything about these refunds from Singapore Airlines.  When I got my credit card statement on 25th of January, 2011, I saw that those charges were on my statement and I have to pay the credit card by the 2nd of February.  I immediately called Singapore Airlines to see why the tickets were not refunded.  They had no idea!  I talked to Shanka, a representative who tried to help me to understand what was going on.  He told that me he was going to look into it and call me back before his shift was over that day.  I did not receive any calls. So, I called again on the 26th of January.  Shanka was not available.  Another representative answered my call and I asked for a supervisor.  He transferred me to Ravi.  I had to explained all situation again, and Ravi told me that the tickets were refunded as of today.  It will take 5 to 13 business days starting from today.  I couldn't accept that because I had to pay to my bank; otherwise, I will get interest and late charges so I wanted to talk to a manager.  He then transferred me to Kamlesh. After I explained everything to Kamlesh again, he told me that they did not get a confirmation from Frankfurt office since today.  But finally, they got it and tickets were already refunded--there is nothing more that can be done.  The refund will take place in 5 to 13 business days.  He assured me that he will look into the reason why it took a month to get a confirmation from Frankfurt and call me tomorrow with an explanation.  But at the same time, he guaranteed that refunds have been issued and I will see it in 5 to 13 business days in my account. Today, 27th of January, Ravi called me and told me that they already talked to Frankfurt office and my refunds will take four to six weeks!  I wanted to talk to Kamlesh who assured me yesterday that refunds have been already issued.  This time, Kamlesh has told me that this is their procedure and there is nothing that can be done.  Frankfurt office will refund these tickets in four to six weeks.  They keep talking about the procedure, which they don't even follow.  They don't even accept their mistakes or disregards.  They don't apologize.  They are only concerned about keeping my money for another month.  So, I have paid double for three tickets, and there is nothing I can do to get my money back.","Consumer Affairs"
2011-01-25,NA,NA,"I booked my ticket to Hyderabad from Incheon (Seoul, Korea) using Singapore airlines via Singapore.  Up to Singapore, it was Singapore Airlines and from Singapore to Hyderabad, SilkAir Airlines.  The date of the journey was 25 Dec 2010.  I reached Singapore at 3:00 PM (SQ603).  I boarded the flight for Hyderabad at 9.30 PM.  Inside the plane, there was an open bolt below the chair handle, because of which, my daughter's finger was injured and it was bleeding.  The air hostess came and she tried to help me out by doing the wound dressing.  But she was not able to do.  She told me that the doctor is outside, so we came out of the plane.  But we found no doctor. In between, the flight took off for Hyderabad.  It was horrible and we received very bad attention from the airline people.  The doctor came after one hour--until then, my daughter was crying because of pain.  The doctor came and saw her and said that she required stitches within 24 hours.  I asked airline people to help me out but they didn't.  Also, I did not have the Singapore visa.  Because of their attitude, I opted to go to Mumbai instead of Hyderabad for which flight was at 2:30 AM. The point here is that Singapore is big airport but no doctor was available that time.  The airline people, instead of helping me, tortured and put us in a condition wherein without medical certificate, we could not travel.  They fooled me by saying that a doctor is available outside while the flight took off.  The air hostess was not trained properly to handle minor injuries and the first aid box was not even complete.  My destination was Hyderabad but after landing in Mumbai, no one helped me on how to go to Hyderabad.  As Mumbai was new to me, it was very painful at the Mumbai airport. As it happened due to the airplane's seat problem, it was their responsibility to bear the charges.  But they compelled me to pay around $100 at the airport for the wound dressing.  Also, the next flight to Hyderabad was scheduled for the next day at the same time.  I said that I will stay but they didn't allow me.  If this message is seen by Singapore or SilkAir Airlines, please improve the SilkAir services.  Also, allot the good seat if the passenger is traveling with infants.  Have a well-trained air hostess.  If you need ticket details, please revert me on **.","Consumer Affairs"

I then called up Singapore Airline's call center. I was taken back that she told me I have no choice. She had been helpful enough to say she would try to allocate ""2"" seats for me and my husband.

2010-12-17,NA,NA,"Unacceptable Singapore Airline's customer service over damaged baggage. I'm a resident of New York and this is the 3rd time I have been flying with Singapore Airline, the first two being with my family. Since I'm flying alone on this trip, I thought I would visit Singapore for a night. Therefore, as per attached itinerary, I left New York (JFK airport) on the night of November 9th and arrived in Singapore on November 11th in the morning. Since it was my very first time ever visiting Singapore, I was the last one arriving at the baggage claim area, dead last. When I arrived there, there was nobody around that area and both my bags (a 21 and a 26 Samsonites) were completely off the carousel and standing on the site. When I got my luggage, I noticed the larger bag, had a nick on the top-front zipper and the zipper was open. However, since I only put a magazine in there, I didn't worry. So, I grabbed my bag, hailed a cab and went to my hotel in Singapore, located at Ulu Pandan Road which is the other end of the town, completely opposite direction of the airport.Back at the hotel, while getting a towel out of the luggage for the shower, I noticed that the plastic encased metal frame of the luggage's lid has been badly bent in two places. Also the inside of the lid has been torn and there were more damages to the zipper. However, due to the distance between my hotel and the airport, going back to the airport wasn't possible. Therefore, I did the next best thing. I checked the Singapore Airline's website and was relieved to read the following paragraphs.Written notice to the carrier must be made within 7 days of the receipt of checked baggage in the case of damage. We have appointed agents to repair your damaged bag as quickly as possible. Details of arrangements will be provided by our local office. Singapore Airlines sincerely apologizes if we have mishandled your baggage and understand that this is an inconvenience. Please be assured that we will do everything possible to assist you through this experience.After reading the above two paragraphs, I thought, great! I still have time to file for the claim and they will take care of me like they did the first two times. Little did I know that how everything possible to assist would turn into everything imaginable to make you so mad and frustrated by throwing you the book and procedures, make you waste lots of your valuable time (so much more than the luggage is worth), wasting hours on the phone with the local agent relaying back and forth with his local manager Mr. **, who apparently is a very shrewd businessman and a negotiator, yet an extremely incompetent executive with absolutely no understanding of customer service. How could a 5-star airline do that you ask? Well, please read on. After my night of stay in Singapore, I arrived at the Singapore Airport around noon the next day (November 12th) with my cousin, who is working at Sing Tel as a manager to see me off. Then, we went to the Singapore Airline customer service counter and talked to the lady there about my situation. My cousin and I haven't had lunch yet by that time and my flight wasn't till 3:00pm. So, we were weighing the option of going to another floor to file the damaged baggage claim, which could take long or just go and have lunch and deal with everything in Yangon. Besides, the lady at customer service said, it was really up to me where to file the claim (in Singapore or in Yangon/Rangoon as well) as Silk Air and Singapore Airline are the same. I said, ""Great, I would deal with it in Yangon since I was born there."" Nonetheless, I was worried that due to the damaged zipper, the luggage would fly open on the way. So, me and my cousin went and bought a roll of duct tape. Then, we went to the Singapore Airline's check-in counter. Again, I told the lady at the check-in counter the same story. ""No problem,"" she said. Just be sure to let them know at the Yangon office, she reminded me. Therefore, I duct-taped my damaged bag right in front of her at the check-in counter. After luggage check-in, lunch, and the security check, I'm aboard the plane, oblivious to the nightmare the Silk Air is waiting to put me through in Yangon. Once I landed in Yangon on the evening of November 12th at 4:30pm, hell started for me. I told her about my damaged luggage and for 2 hours I defended like a guilty criminal to a barrage of accusations. Why didn't you file the claim when it happened? Why didn't you go back from the hotel to the airport? Why didn't you file it the next day at the airport? What could we do as it didn't happen here? You should have, could have, blah blah blah. How could the staff at Singapore check-in allow such taped luggage? Felt like I was interrogated for treason. After one hour of questioning and me defending, it became obvious that she did not even want to open a claim report, saying it didn't happen here; it happened in Singapore, where I should have claimed. Only after my repeated urging, negotiating, which took about an hour by the way, did she contacted her manager over the phone and finally a black-and-white form called Property Irregularity Report (PIR) is filled. She did quip that she only accepted the claim as a Courtesy Case. To me, it sure felt like they are extremely courteous. Of course, it is only the beginning.As the PIR form is starting to be filled, she weighed my two checked-in luggages which turned out to be 40 Kgs (about 88 pounds) combined. Now she started questioning why it said Bags: 2/28 (2 bags, 28 Kgs) in the claim ticket. How would I know? It was the airline's employees who weighed the bag. It was the airline's scale, the airline's printout. I am just a lowly customer who just wants to travel from point A to point B with all my bags intact. By now, you are asking, was that all? No sir. No. She still had some tricks up her sleeve.At this point lots of photos were taken. As the PIR form was filled, it came to the Description of damage part and she asked me when I bought these baggage. I told her that I bought it specifically for this trip. She asked if I have proof. Sorry, I do not make a habit of taking a luggage receipt on my vacation with the intent of claim. I might not even have it at home any more. Besides, my return flight is 4 months away. However, there was at least physical proof that my luggage are new. I bought this 3 piece set (1 gym bag, 1x21, and 1x26 all for $240. A value of $100 was agreed and filled in for the damaged bag and I think it's a fair value). It's Samsonite and the brand new luggage labels were still on all three and all three are sparkling new (other than the major damage on the largest one). What more proof would you need? At any rate, another hour passed and I was done and I was relieved that it was over and leaving the airport dead last. I was told take the bag to the airline's office the following Monday, so that the manager there could see the damage. Now, as I was going through this lady's maze on inside for 2 hours, my 73-year-old uncle, my 69-year-old aunt, and other relatives were waiting outside sitting, standing, wandering, and wondering what was happening inside as they could clearly see me through the glass. All in all, my dealings with this lovely lady called Chaw Chaw was over a new nightmare was still waiting for me at the local Silk Air office. Monday, November 15th came and I went to the office with my luggage thinking it was a matter of giving them the damaged one and getting the fair replacement value. No sir. The lady there said, Sir, you will be happy to know that we will be getting your luggage fixed at the local Samsonite Company. I said, sure, hoping they could get it fixed despite the damages being marked Major on PIR. Three days later, I went there notifying them that I would be traveling for 1-2 months and if there wasn't enough time, I would be willing to get the luggage when I got back. Then, I was told that Samsonite Company had deemed my luggage unrepairable. And I was told that they will be trying some local company and I was to inspect the luggage and see if the repair was satisfactory. The lady at the office told me, if the repair wasn't satisfactory, I could let them know and they will arrange something else, leaving the option of buying me a new bag or paying me the fair value. Two days later, I went to the office again to see the repaired luggage. The inside tear was repaired nicely. However, the metal frame was still bent in two places as before. As this metal rim was extremely thick and encased in tailored plastic, they probably weren't able to repair without completely dismantling the lid. As this was going on, I had a chance to visit the local markets and see what a baggage like that would cost me and I noticed that even a no-name Chinese branded 18 luggage runs about $90. Any decent 26 luggage would be selling for over $140. Mind you, that's not even a US brand name item like Samsonite.At the Silk Air office, after I told the lady that the repair did not fix my luggage, she asked me to write an explanation letter for the manager so that the manager could compensate me directly. Of course, I did exactly that writing a 2-page explanation letter of the events. As I was set to travel all over Myanmar (Burma) for a couple of months on the 24th of November, I got a called on November 23rd from the local office manage, Mr. **'s assistant Ko **, who was quite polite and apologized profoundly for the ordeal I have went through at the airport. Then, he relayed to me what Mr. ** was prepared to compensate for my luggage: $50. What? Suddenly, I felt like I was no longer a computer consultant earning $50-$150/hr and turned into local luggage hustlers marking a buck here and there. The only reason I was preparing to accept the $100 luggage was because, one, I do not need a luggage to go back to US; I have a spare from my uncle, and two, that was what I have paid for and the fair market value and I could get another one once I'm back to the States. Now, with Mr. **'s offer of $50, there was nowhere else in the world (neither local nor in the US) that I could get a 26 Samsonite luggage. I had been nothing but polite up to that point. However, that $50 felt like a slap across my face. It also became apparent to me that Singapore Airline does enjoy making a buck here and there and would do anything to save a penny at all cost. I let ** relayed how upset I was to Mr. ** and I went on my trip the next day, on the 24th of November. After spending a month of ruined vacation and unpleasant trip (mind you, my mind was on my luggage), I cut my trip short and was back in Yangon. This morning (December 17th), I receive a polite call from Ko ** again, carrying Mr. **'s message that, the $50 was not a compensation for the luggage. It was a Good Will Gift while I wait for another set of the airline's red-tape (another insurance claim, he said) which could take 2 to 3 months. He said I could go through it on my return trip which was 4 months away. I was also told that even though Mr. ** does have the authority for the complete compensation (in some cases only, according to Ko **), he, the Head of the Silk Air for the country of Myanmar, might have to go though steps to report this case back to Singapore Headquarter. Yes. All for that $50. I mean, my God. All this courteous service from Asia's leading airline? With the best service? I flew with China Airlines at least 4 times. Their fares are lower and their transit city in Taiwan is nicer. They have not even damaged my luggage once. Finally, here is my message to Singapore Airline. Yes. Please throw me the book and ask me to jump though the hoops. I do not mind as there will be no more complaint from me in Yangon once I emailed this to all the blogs, airline complaint websites, news agencies, government agencies, and any website willing to publish. I guess anybody searching for Singapore Airline will see my story right underneath your official site.My friends and relatives kept telling me, just take the $50. The remaining $50 is nothing to you as you could easily earn it in an hour. Why waste so many hours going to the local office, spending taxi fares, and spending time haggling over the phone for that measly $50. Let it go. Well, the problem here is no longer about $50. It's about how an airline that claims to have the best service could end up with such disservice to the customer. It's about how the Singapore Airline has completely ruined a customer's vacation. It's about how an airline could push a customer to the brink of hypertension by being so discourteous. It's about how even a patient customer who earns $50/hr like me could be so upset that he would spend all day to write a 5-page complaint. As with any good insurance coverage, it's about returning the customer to the condition before the accident. Before the accident, I have a brand new Samsonite bag worth $50. If I were to accept Mr. **'s $50, who is going to pay for the other $50? My 73 year old poor uncle who spent 2 hours waiting at the airport?However, you'll be happy to know that, I have already saved Singapore Airline that $100 and more. My friend who is flying from Washington DC to Yangon just bought a ticket from ANA, the Japanese Airline, due to my urging. The Singapore Airline's lost? Definitely going to be more than my luggage is going to cost. My dad, mom, wife, kid, friends and their relatives all travel at least once a year to Yangon, all of whom will be converted to China Airlines. Cost to Singapore Airlines? Over $10,000, if I have to guess. So, congratulations to Mr. **. You have definitely save your airlines a fair amount of money with empty seats. I won't be surprised to find the airline suddenly bankrupt in a few years.PS: I also would like to thank Ko **, Mr. **'s assistant, for suggesting that a customer always have the right to a complaint and my complaint could also correct some failed procedure within the company and transfer some authority to his boss Mr. Atwill ** who as seen in the picture probably need more customer service training and lady charm than the authority for $50.PPS: You might think that I'm a bad customer who complains every single thing. I'm not. When stewardess request to switch seats, I always have. When stewardess brought the wrong meal, I never complain. After all, all my flights are always shorter than 24 hours. No point complaining every single thing. However, this is physical damage/Financial loss due to the airline's mishandling. I believe should be made whole PPPS: As I have explained in my first two-page hand-written letter, what's the point of wasting everybody's time? Your staff has apologized for the bad service at the airport. I accepted it. You pay for my bag or buy me an equivalent bag and we both moved on. If you can get it for $10 locally, then, congratulations are in order, as you have saved $90 for your beloved airline. Obviously, Mr. ** doesn't have that authority or willingness to do that.

I decided to try Singapore Airlines because they are a partner of Continental's Star Alliance.  I asked Continental if the economy on Singapore would provide miles and elite miles.  I was assured yes.  I bought a ticket.  I endured long flights, 27,000 miles round trip.  I found out after the fact that they had sold me a ""Q"" fare which wouldn't provide the elite miles for my qualification to gold and my wife's to silver for next year. I got no miles.  Singapore has no customer service number.  I submitted my concerns online over a week ago.  I got no response.  Singapore customer service is horrible.

2010-09-07,NA,NA,"Firstly, I am a Krisflyer member and use SQ whenever possible. On 23 July 2010, I was on time and near the front of the queue to check in for a flight from Johannesburg to Singapore. At the check-in desk, my baggage was found to be 7kg over the allowance and for the first time ever in my many years of using SQ. The supervisor insisted that I pay excess baggage at a rate of 50 USD per additional kilo. I politely asked that she be reasonable and use some discretion to which she replied the flight was full to capacity and there was nothing she could do. Under normal circumstances, I would have accepted the situation and let it go but on this occasion, I had noticed that the four guys on the next check-in desk who were all traveling together were well over the combined allowance and yet had been passed through without a word. I pointed this out to the supervisor and again asked that she apply some common sense and discretion to the situation. My presentation was ignored and I ended up having to pay 350 USD for excess baggage. Now whether my white skin was a factor in this situation or not I am not entirely sure but the thought certainly crossed my mind, particularly as I had heard several similar type of complaints before during my time in South Africa (please note I am not a South African). To make matters worse the elderly Australian woman behind me who was traveling on her own to Perth was also charged for excessive baggage this time it being a paltry 3kg (150 USD). The lack of discretion and indifference shown by the SQ supervisor in the situation incensed me as I had never come across such an off-handed attitude before in all my travels with SQ. When I boarded the flight to Singapore I inquired of the cabin crew whether the flight was actually full to capacity or not - to my surprise I was told that economy class had approx 230 out of the available 265 seats occupied and that business class was relatively empty. So it transpired that the check-in supervisor had lied to me about the plane being full - it would also appear that the aircraft had sufficient spare payload capacity from the empty seats etc to allow the supervisor to use some degree of discretion. Being lied to by check-in staff employed by an airline of SQ's pedigree is unacceptable. Favoring some passengers over others as regards baggage allowance is also unacceptable. I have always held SQ in the highest regard for its service and assistance offered to its passengers. I am disappointed to say that the SQ check-in staff at OR Tambo in my estimation did not come up to the mark and possibly need to be better trained in people management skills and the use of discretion regardless of color, creed or persuasion of the passengers they may be dealing with. The experience has not put me off flying with SQ, I just hope that they take on-board my above comments and do something constructive to make traveling through OR Tambo a more pleasant experience for all their passengers. 350USD with the added inconvenience of having to find an ATM machine and the added time that the checking-in process took.","Consumer Affairs"

We were so confused when we got home. We were supposed to meet a Singapore rep who did not turn up after an hour. We were very upset. I left to go home fifteen minutes from home and had a near fatal car accident. My wife was trapped in the car for two hours. Rushed by helicopter to a local hospital. Very bad bruising and abrasions. It was very traumatic. Got in touch with Singapore to tell them what happened. Did not even respond. A whole family was nearly wiped out and they could not even make a phone call. Best airline in the world? Do not think so. No one will talk to us. Who is going to talk to us? Where does someone out there say, â€œI will talk to youâ€? We paid extra for this not to happen.

2010-04-19,NA,NA,"We booked four full packages to Singapore for a family holiday directly with Singapore Airlines tour desk in person in Manila.  We asked all the right questions. Singapore Airlines recommended Valentines' Day Feb. 2010 because of ""great shopping"" and great food venues. But the dates they selected for us were also Chinese New Year and National Defense Day and for most of our stay, the entire city was closed tight, no shopping, no restaurants, no museums. Then, on the return flight, when one of us had a reaction to the food which was not supposed to contain eggs which they are allergic to--the senior flight staff said they had the ingredients in the food on board and that there were no eggs in the meal. Twenty four hours after the flight, the corporate office of Singapore Airlines finally responded to our urgent inquiry and informed us that in fact, they did not have the ingredients on the plane and that there were in fact eggs in the mashed potato. We do not understand why the senior flight person did not tell us they did not have the ingredients and made up that there were no eggs when there were. Because we believed them, we took steps we would not otherwise have taken if we did not have the ingredients and did not believe them there were no eggs in the food.  This made us think it was some other more serious medical problem.  We had an RN traveling with us, we are sure of our facts. Singapore Airlines Manila also misrepresented the hotel they booked us in as part of the 5-star Peninsula Hotel group.  It was a 3-star hotel only, they repeated this misrepresentation in writing over the signature of the Manila manager. There are many other aspects to this matter that indicate questionable actions by the Manila office of Singapore Airlines--yet when we try to make a corporate complaint, we are told by the Manila office of Singapore Airlines that we are only allowed to complain to the Manila office, not the corporate office--even though it is the Manila office that is responsible for most of what has been wrongful here! They have even tried to get us to accept all responsibility for everything that happened! Most important is why should we not have the right to address this directly with Singapore Airlines corporate office? Why should we and the people of the Philippines only be allowed to complain to the Manila office which is responsible for the problems? They admitted some of the wrong-doings and offered us four tickets (nothing like the value of the four packages) but then changed the valid dates of the tickets, significantly reducing their validity and made other changes in what they had written was the value of the tickets so as to make them virtually unusable and worthless. We are presently still trying to get some understanding from the Manila office and wish we could complain directly to Singapore Airlines, Singapore.  Note: We did not use an agent, we dealt only directly with Singapore Airlines itself.","Consumer Affairs"

2009-08-15,NA,NA,"In Oct 2008, I made a booking at Singapore Airlines website for the flight Colombo - Singapore - Colombo, with booking reference. This booking was made for me by my sister with her Visa credit card. The full amount of $750 was charged by Singapore Airlines from my sister's account three weeks before I had to board my flight. It's important to say that with the confirmation that was sent to my e-mail, was the new one rule, not mentioned during the booking, ""Since you are not part of the traveling party, you will be required to sign a letter of indemnity (LOI) and submit it personally, by mail, or by fax to the nearest Singapore Airlines office."" In accordance with the above, my sister signed this letter of indemnity, and we sent it to Singapore Airlines office in Tel-Aviv, Israel by fax (she lives and works in Israel). After sending it, she called their office, and they approved, that they got this letter and ""everything was okay, no need to come"". In Nov 2008, I was denied boarding to my flight from Colombo (Sri-Lanka) to Singapore. As far as local Singapore Airlines officials explained, it was ""some problem with my reservation"". Because of their extremely bad English, they could not explain what the problem was exactly. I tried to tell them that my sister was charged in full for this flight, and that it was impossible that any problem remained. They did not respond, but asked to see my (again, my credit card, not sister's!) credit card. They took from me the credit card for about 5 minutes, and returned it back with an already printed transaction(!) for LKR 226,800 ($2,067) and asked me to sign it. They said that for security reasons, I needed to sign it and explained that they will refund me this amount later. Again, they could not explain what  ""security reasons"" meant and why I needed to pay $2,067 in addition to $750 already paid for the tickets. I said that my sister was fully charged and I did not intend to sign this transaction in this case. They answered, that if I did not sign, I would be denied boarding. I said that no way would I sign in any case, and they had no legal right to use my credit card for payments without my permission and authorization. After that, I said that if they did not let me board my flight, I would demand from them an official letter for the reason of this denial to fly, and later we would meet in the court. They talked in Sinhala (Sri-Lankan language) between them for about 5 minutes, so I could not understand what they were talking about. They made some calls as well. Finally, they decided to let me board my flight. I asked them that I needed to be sure, that this amount of $2,067 would not be charged and they said, ""Don't worry mister, that's okay."" Some time ago, I discovered that I was charged by Sri-Lankan Airlines(!) for $2,067 mentioned above in addition to the $750 already charged from my sister's account. I talked with Singapore Airlines call center. They asked me to send them ""unused coupons"" for Colombo-Singapore-Colombo flight. However, as I said above, I did not buy any additional tickets. That's why I had no any ""unused coupons"" to send them back. This problem hasn't been solved until now (6 months!) and, actually, according to the law, I have to apply to the Singaporean court in order to get refund.","Consumer Affairs"
2009-07-30,NA,NA,"My name is Mina ** from Melbourne. I have invited my mother-in-law, Mrs. Amal ** and my sister-in-law (5 years old) Ms. Jessie ** to visit Australia. We have chosen Singapore Airlines due to its good reputation. They were supposed to travel back from Melbourne to Cairo on Thursday, 18th June on flight SQ-228. We went to the airport three hours early and went to check in. We met their customer service officer Diane to check in the bags. They took two bags and gave us flight tickets and evidence for receiving these two bags. We have received these papers and went to the plane way. My cousin was there and she suggested that my mother-in-law could carry another handbag in her hand. I looked and found out that some passengers could carry small handbag while traveling. I said that's fine, we gave her the handbag and if she can't pass, we will just take this extra handbag. And if she passes, it's good for her. She took this extra handbag and showed her papers to officer on the way out to the plane. The officer has checked her bags and he allowed her to pass through. We waived to them and we left the airport. Twenty minutes later, I received a phone call from one guy who's telling me that Mrs. Amal ** and Ms. Jessie ** have some problems in the airport. I told him that I am driving right now and will drive back to the airport straight away. We got so stressed something gone wrong in the plane. I have reached the airport back in twenty minutes and found out my mother-in-law and sister-in-law just crying as crazy in the middle of the airport and they just pointed to this lady Diane. I have asked Diane, ""What's going on?"". She said that they have tried to get an extra handbag so Diane decided to punish them by canceling their flight! I told Diane that they are visitors and their Visa will expire today and if they can't travel this day, they will lose security bond of $10,000 and may get penalty not to enter Australia for another five years. She said that they have done something and they should pay for their mistake. I offered her that we just take this extra handbag and let them travel, but she refused. I have explained to Diane that we saw another passenger got extra weight and the officer allowed them to pass without any problems and without canceling their flight. Diane said these passengers have Golden card to allow them for extra twenty kilos weight. I told Diane that we had never seen this card and the officer just told them to carry only 25kg per passenger for the next trip. Besides, the guy who was in front of me was carrying a 28kg bag and another big plastic package of electronic guitar weighing 15kg. The officer again accepted to pass him and she did stick two labels (fragile) on the guitar. So the problem wasn't the weight. The problem is that this officer Diane picked on us for some reasons and just got her chance to cancel the flights for this reason. I had asked Diane to give me a phone number for Singapore Airlines' head office to fix this problem, but she refused and refused as well to let us talk to her supervisor. By the time, I could get a number for the Singapore Airlines' number from the yellow pages, it was too late and we could only reserve on Saturday, 20th June. Diane was so rude with us and so loud in front of other customer service officers. They couldn't get an interpreter for an Arabic language to talk with my mother-in-law, so they have asked help from another airlines' company member (Emirates)! I am contacting the Australian immigration right now and hopefully, we'll get a 48-hour extension to get over this problem.","Consumer Affairs"

2009-07-01,NA,NA,"On Thursday, April 16, 2009, I fell ill and was treated in a renovated hospital in Pretoria, South Africa. Diagnostic conclusion included a surgeon's advice for further urgent treatment. This was either in South Africa or, preferably, in my home town in Thailand. This medical advice prompted me to return the soonest to Thailand and change my return date planned for the May 4. My wife approached the Chiang Mai travel agent for an early new return date. It took 2 days to establish that a change had to be arranged in South Africa. Question here is why. I contacted a travel agent in South Africa on April 18. They could not help but gave me all available Singapore Airlines telephone numbers in Johannesburg and at the Or Thambo airport. I tried all the numbers and spoke to several ""first name"" persons. The outcome was negative; no one could change my return date though all of them advised the additional cost of such requested change would amount to, which I accepted to pay. On April 20, I returned to the SA travel agent. I tried to arrange a change of date to return and eventually managed to get a ticket for collection on April 28 and fly on that date. Early that date, the agent told me they cannot issue a ticket, because I did not book with them in Thailand. How could they when they have no offices in Thailand? Again, why? Here I stand with suitcase packed, rented car returned, and sick as a dog. So I went to the airport and told your office staff there that I demand a return ticket on that day. Suddenly, there appeared to be no problem, except that a credit card was not acceptable. So I have to go to a bank for cash money. Nice service. The departure time was to be 13.15 hours. Then I was waiting and waiting, and no one knew why. It turned out that the catering failed and there was no food on board the aeroplane. So the plane cannot leave until 17.00 hours. So much for Singapore Airlines planning department. The whole return time schedule is now messed up. Next stage, Singapore-Bangkok. I don't know at which times and last stage with Thai Airways got me home after a more than 30-hour exhausting journey. As to value for money, it is surely one of the least satisfactory air trips I have made in my life. I suggest you look at this message seriously for your own good. My physical condition was most certainly adversely affected by this experience. I am presently recuperating from the needed surgery.

The consequences are, if your credit card has insufficient funds, you won't fly even if you can prove you were the person that bought the original tickets.

She purchased on-line. The plan was for all three of us to return together to Manchester i.e.on the same flights and obviously we want to be seated together.  Now the problem. It appears that customers who purchase via travel agents cannot access the booking website in order to select seats until 48 hours prior to flight departure. Conversely m daughter who booked on-line has been able to select seats and she has 5 weeks yet until she leaves Heathrow. I have contacted Singapore Air and described these differences in access to seat selection as discrimination. They have responded only in that they deny any form of discrimination yet accept that I am correct about the inability of customers who either book via telephone or travel agents to select seats prior to 48 hours. Why am I being treated as some second class passenger just because I booked via my travel agent?  Responses arrive from Kate, Sue, John etc, never the same person and the last email received was quite rude in it's response and certainly not customer friendly. I've yet to fly with them yet I know already that my flight next year will not be via this company. The impact is that we cannot be certain or sure that my family can sit adjacent to each other.","Consumer Affairs"
2009-01-14,NA,NA,"On 22 December my husband and I were forced by Singapore Airlines to pay for tickets for us to fly from Singapore to Auckland, even though we were already the holders of VALID TICKETS issued by Singapore Airlines in March 2008.  This occurred because in the months between purchasing the original tickets on the singapore website and taking the flight, our credit card number had been changed, and we therefore could not produce the original card, which was requested when we checked in.  We had no choice in the matter and were told by the ticketing officer that the old tickets would be credited to our credit card immediately. This did not happen and I we have had to chase the money. Also consider the following:  1.The ticket and the card were in the same name, so why would someone fraudulently use OUR credit card to book a flight OUR NAMES?  2.If someone did fraudulently use our credit card in March how would we have not known about it NINE months later?  3.What would have happened if our card not had sufficient funds available to buy the extra tickets?  The situation now is that Singapore Airlines have been paid twice for the same seats on the flight, and have been extremely tardy in applying the promised refund. The end result of this policy is that it serves only Singapore Airlines.  They have had use of our money for the original tickets since March.  In addition they now have use of our money that we have been forced to pay for a second set of tickets.  On top of this we have to pay the bank charges that will undoubtedly accrue on these transactions and will lose money on the exchange rate as it has gone down.","Consumer Affairs"
2008-12-18,NA,NA,"I am very disappointed with Singapore Airlines in Dubai. I have purchased an air-ticket on line travel from Dubai to Singapore and Singapore to Dubai. Due to some reason, I intend to only travel from Dubai to Singapore (1 way ticket instead of 2 ways) The staff of Singapore Airline in Dubai told me that I can't change my air ticket from 2 ways to 1 way. I have to cancel my 2 way air-ticket losing AED 300 and repurchase again a 1 way air-ticket. I told him it is fine for me. However, again he told me that the refund will be credited back to my original credit card. The issue is that my original credit card has been cancelled. What is the point of credited back the money to my original credit card? I proposed to him the following but none has been either approved or confirmed by the staff of singapore airline in Dubai. (a) Let me change the 2 way ticket to 1 way and refund me back the balance in cash (either pay me in Dubai or Singapore) or credited back the money to my another credit card. Singapore Airline's answer is NO!!! The policy cannot be done in this way. (b) I used my credit card cancel form issued by the bank as proof and credited back the refund to my another credit card. Singapore Airline's answer is --- cancel the air ticket in the ticketing office and go to him in another office and fill up a form and he will sent the document to singapore for approval. No guarantee I will get the refund. Very funny!!! I cancel the entire air-ticket (cost me AED 3180) and repurchase another 1 way air-ticket (AED 2000). If end of the day I can't get the refund at all, means I have to spend AED 5180 to fly from Dubai to Singapore!!!! Now I have no choice, in view of the inflexible policy of Singapore Airline, I have to utilise the 2 way ticket for only 1 way. It means that I have to waste AED 1180 for nothing!!!! Singapore Airline - wake up to be the best airline in the world. Be more flexible in your policy!!! It does not means you have to use chopstick all the time!!! Sometimes, you can also use fork, spoon or even using hands to eat your rice!!!!","Consumer Affairs"

I was using the supplied dates and still couldnt get any further.I tried three different cards and they all said the same fill in a valid expiry date. What is this, some game? it has cost me four hours and still no ticket.I rang Sing Airlines office in Beijing and they quoted me three times the price for the same flights, same flight codes and dates, as the machine was quoting. I guess this is so customers dont bother the staff wanting service.The person there told me to ring another travel agent and when I did the number would not connect. GREAT SERVICE!!! Give him a medal. I do not want legal action I just want the system fixed so that nobody else or myself has to go through this again as it is very frustrating and in my case I now have to fly and hope I can purchase a ticket at the other end.","Consumer Affairs"

During my return journey Singapore airline duty officer Mr. Varun Kapoor harassed me for more then three hours for boarding pass. He was saying that you are unauthorized to travel; you dont have any legal document for your travel. On that day I was traveling 7th time by Singapore airline with same document I use for my travel in past. In past I start my traveling from Mumbai and Delhi but nobody behave like this.

2008-05-04,NA,NA,"I believed that Singapore airline is one of the finest airlines around the World due to its quality service that exceeds customers expectation. However, I experience an unacceptable and unprofessional service in your office in Kuwait for these reasons:     Your staff (Ms. Fatma) gave me a questionable figure (410KD) 2 way - air ticket cost for a 2 month old infant from Davao to Kuwait. I asked her two times if there is a discount because my son is still an infant and Hes travelling with his mother but says NO DISCOUNT. This prompts me to get a ticket for my son from other agent which cost far less than 410KD.     Your staff (Ms. Fatma) ignored our agreed timeline to call me back regarding the status of my Inquiry. Last April 06 (Sunday) I went to Singapore office Kuwait and requested her to look April 24, 25, 26, 27 for a vacant of two from Davao to Kuwait. I explained to her that if theres vacant she can book my wife and sister in law on the same date as my wife is carrying my 2 month old son and in order that theres someone who can help her of taking care for my son during the flight. I say to her please inform me maximum by WEDNESDAY (April 09, 2008) if theres vacant as she agrees. However, she calls me on Thursday afternoon @ 4:40pm (April 10, 2008) one day after the agreed date where I already finalized the ticket of my son and coordinated with my wifes employer.     Your staff (Ms. Fatma) calls me on Thursday afternoon and tells me that she booked my sister in law on 29th of April from June 04. I loudly reiterate to NO NEED to change anything. What SHOCKS me when she calls me for the second time and says that she booked my wife on June 04 from April 17, 2008. I said to her no need to change anything as if I didnt come in your office?. However, she tells me that April 17 is already cancelled. I was so disappointed and almost lost my temper during that time but, I still manage to ask her to look vacant on 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 for my wife to be back to Kuwait. Since then, Ive been coordinating with your Kuwait office from time to time through telephone, email and personal appearance (even talked to their office boss  Al Rayes Travel) requesting them to do the necessary measures for my wife to be back maximum by 21st of April as my wife employer will terminate her if she exceeds more days from the 5 months vacation leave (Nov. 19  April 19). With continues follow-ups and coordination, your Kuwait office found and booked my wife and son on 22nd of April from Davao to Kuwait. On 15th of April, I went to Singapore airline Kuwait to ask the details of the 22nd April booking; I talked to Fatma, Sheryar Shroff (Operations Supervisor) and they tell me that 22nd is confirmed however the airlines from Dubai to Kuwait is not Kuwait Airways but instead Emirates Airways. I asked them if theres a possibility to take out the baggage from Dubai since my wife and son will take Emirates Airways as per 22nd booking. Mr. Sheryar Shroff reiterated that no problem regarding the baggage and one thing to do with the new ticket is that a stamp will be placed showing that my wife & son will take Emirates Airways. He further emphasizes that no problem with that because Hes going to write a note on the system (22nd booking) and send an email to Silk Air office in Davao regarding the details for the 22nd booking; He clearly pointed out that only one thing Im going to do is to informed my wife or any person related to me to go to Silk Air Davao and get the new ticket. On 22nd of April my sister in law calls me that Davao Airport told and demanded my wife to take the baggage from Dubai as Dubai to Kuwait ticket is NOT CONFIRMED! I calmly told my irritated sister in law to be calm as Im going to check this issue to Singapore airlines Kuwait. Sad to say your Singapore airlines office staff tells me that someone from Silk Air Davao cancelled the Dubai to Kuwait ticket of my wife & son (I dont know if its true or just an alibi). I was very upset that time however; it cant help to solve the problem. Same time I cant allow my wife & 2 month old son to stay and wait in Dubai International Airport for unknown hours or days and thus, I coordinated and again beg for help to Singapore Airlines Kuwait and other personalities for my wife & 2 month old son safety and for them to be in Kuwait the next day. 23rd of April, they arrived in Kuwait International Airport safely however, the baggage was delayed for one day.     With the sleepless night, emotional hatred and moral damages I experience with Singapore Airlines Kuwait and for you to do the necessary corrective & preventive actions I made this complaint Likewise, Im expecting an appropriate action from your side.     For more clarifications, dont hesitate to email me back and please, let me know your feedbacks and the corrective actions.","Consumer Affairs"
2006-06-12,NA,NA,"Bad experience on my last flight with Singapore Airlines, and the company never responded to polite e-mails and a registered letter I send them, well over a month ago:   Here is what happened:  I checked into their flight from Phuket to Singapore and on to Zurich 3 hours before flight time or some 6 hours before their flight on to Zurich, Switzerland. Yet, I was not given an aisle seat (they were as I was told all blocked off), then I endured a horrible trip over resulted in some food poisening/stomach problems for 4 days while doing important business in Zurich, Switzerland.     I note: Increasingly Airlines block off whole rows of seats and this way in advance, so discriminating against individual travelers.    I then booked my trip back in Zurich and raised this bad experience to their helpful employee at Singapore's Zurich office. On the way back, again seats where blocked off, even while I requested a seat 10 days before returning. Here is the real complaint:  On the way back to Phuket, some 3-4 days later, I contracted (diagnosed at the Bangkok-Phuket hospital here)  as having a case of Sialadinitis a very painful & rare infection of the saliva gland, most likely contracted through bad water evaporation system in their plane?  Hence I wonder if other cases have been reported?    I was astonished as I am a healthy non-smoker professional and it is highly unlike to have been contracted this other then by having boarded that flight. I do have full medical certificates for the serious infection I was beared to now brunt (but now better) and sent those Hospital diagnostic papers in English to their Bangkok/Singapore office in mid May.   No response at all.   I do feel some kind of remuneration is in order due to this double whammy, on both flights, I just endured.  But when I wrote them in a cordial way they never answered. I just asked again, but again no answer. Singapore Airlines does not seem to care at all.","Consumer Affairs"

2016-09-23,"An appalling experience",2,"My wife and I had the misfortune to fly business class on Singapore Airlines from Singapore to Sydney (SQ0221) in the evening of 18th of September 2106. It was booked via our travel agent. We did so primarily due to a five hour stopover in Singapore and so that we could sleep on the plane that night (important at my now 86). Apart from zero service the lounge was fine. The flight was on time. On taking our seats we advised the staff we did not need dinner and that we were going to sleep. We spent a long time attempting to lower the seat to the bed position (including checking the instructions that stated that two reclining positions were available - as seemingly also on the control unit). All we could find was a semi-reclining diagonal situation that left a substantial leg gap with feet crammed sideways onto a small hard shelf. It was totally obvious to the crew that this was so. At no time did they advise there was any other adjustment. Despite previously advising we did not require dinner the crew woke both of us when dinner was served. It was impossible for them not to have noted our extraordinary semi-reclining and hugely uncomfortable positions - but made no attempt to assist. At one time I awoke and noted that whilst most passengers were awake - of the only two others asleep both were in a similar manner. When awoken for the inadequate 'breakfast' of a stale roll, orange juice and coffee the attendant said 'why did you not call me last night - you have to do that if you want the bed to be set up correctly'. We said we had not as (to quote (page 84 of the Silverchris publication) it states only that 'Business Class on the new A350-900 and the 777-300ER aircraft features greater recline and two new seating positions'. There is no mention of a fully reclining bed option - let alone that an attendant has to be approached to do it for one. The only response was to the (obvious) effect the instructions were insufficient. There was no hint of an apology or response to my comment that surely it would be the staff's responsibility to ensure passenger comfort. The result was a still sore back and a waste of thousands of dollars. I click one star - but only because there is not a minus star rating. We will never fly with this airline again.","Product Review"

The booking process was terrible, because the computer would not recognise my husband's passport and he had to stand in the checkout queue for an hour. That was just the start. The cabin crew are like smiling robots that could not help with anything. The woman in front of me decided she was in her lazyboy chair in her lounge and lay on top of me for thirteen hours which the smiling robots told me was her right. As a result I spent five hours standing at the back of the plane and when I sat down on the steps to the upper deck was told I could not sit there. The smiling robots thought it was funny that a women of sixty six had no seat. I was spoken to like a child. We were not given entry cards to Singapore on board which was another delay. I would hate to be on this airline when a disaster occurred as the smiling robots appear to be unable to make decisions.","Product Review"

2016-08-05,"Disappointment gradually setting in",6,"I fly at least once a year to Europe from Australia. I used to fly Qantas and was initially attracted by the new alliance with Emirates and the promise to fly direct into 17 European cities. Until I tried it a couple of times, came to despise Dubai airport, and realized that most of these flights have a very long connection. After occasional long-haul SQ flights through the 90s, have been flying with them regularly the past 5 years or so. The service in general is great, Changi is great, but I have been becoming increasingly annoyed/disappointed by is the quality of the planes and the flight experience. A380s are fantastic but only fly the major destinations. In most other planes (lately mainly 777s?), seats are uncomfortable, everything is tired and seems somewhat dirty. Many planes with very old entertainment systems. Food is frequently a tasteless mush - a far cry from what it used to be. Cost cutting leading to these ridiculous gaps in service where the only food is self-service chips, chocolate and noodles for 8h or so. On my latest trip I also noticed a couple of bizarre things. On one flight, I noticed a strange cloying sweet chalky smell on the air, and then I saw cabin crew regularly opening toilet doors and spraying something inside - this was the smell. Deodorant? Disinfectant? Also, on another flight (different plane) I started to notice actual toilet smells coming through on the air. I have been flying regularly for 25 years and struggle to recall ever noticing anything like this before. Anyone noticed this or have any idea what is going on?","Product Review"

While I know an offer like this is not something any traveler can expect from an Airline, and that it is rarely seen, it has put Singapore Airlines to the forefront of my mind in terms of excellent customer service and brand. For this I am telling my friends and family what Singapore Airlines has done and I know that when I book to Turkey next trip Singapore Airlines will be at the top of my list for choice. Even my travel insurance company where I'd paid an additional $3,000 cancellation cover, wangled out of reimbursing my airline cost by using the 'we don't cover military action' clause.

My request was denied by Singapore Airlines because I was an adult. No other reason. I escalated my request but each and every time my request was denied. Of both the Low Sodium and Low Fat options I ended up selecting, each and every meal was fish which by my return flights was frustrating due to the repetitiveness and that I'm not a big fish fan. Not a big deal most people would say however during my flights back to Australia I became ill because I could barely eat any of the food. One flight didn't even have any fresh fruit available. Singapore Airlines have subsequently advised that in future I can have the Child's Meal but I won't be taking that chance after being repeatedly denied on both my outgoing and incoming flights to Australia.

2016-07-18,"Terribly disappointing for a reputed airline",2,"Flew from Melbourne to Singapore and return. Uncomfy seats (you could feel the lumps and bumps in the seat) and old, tired and grotty planes on both sectors. Had to use the wet towels to clean the tray table, etc. Ended up with a rash on my lower arm (contact point) which was against the arm rest. Worst airline meal I have had (and I am an ex flight stewardess). Out of Melbourne a choice of two hot meals but nothing else on the tray other than a cold bread roll. No salad, no dessert no crackers and cheese and no bar service either. Just a tray of juice, beer and sparkling wine. I was shocked. Asked for a bottle of water and was told they don't serve bottled water. Beware - tank water on an aircraft is deadly. Managed to get one from Business class and was told ""SQ was cost cutting"". In this day and age - not serving bottle water is ridiculous. Breakfast prior to landing was another awful meal - eggs or curry noodles. Stale fruit salad (just about 5 tiny pieces of fruit), cold bread roll again. Return sector was a tad better with the dinner service. Breakfast was bad though with a hot egg meal and rock hard cold muffin. Flight attendants were very new on both sectors - one on the return was outstanding even though she had only one month under her belt. Asked for bottle water to be given the same story but she sourced a few sealed cups of water from left over meal trays and brought it over. To cap it off - extremely obese pax given a seat in the center and he could not even get into the first isle seat leave alone the center seat. So I had to swap seats. Now the ground staff would have noticed this on check in and should have made arrangements to accommodate him. They are quick to take your money for an extra leg room seat or offer you an upgrade if you are willing to pay - likewise they should either weigh these overweight pax and charge them extra and cater for them too. I would have been in strife if we had an emergency as I would not have been able to get out in a hurry. I sat for 8 hours without even a washroom visit as he had fallen asleep and was too big to move. Don't mean to discriminate however we do have an issue with an overweight population and they make it very uncomfy for their fellow pax. He was practically spilling into my seat and I was cramped. The crew could not offer me a change of seat due to a full flight. So you pay full fare and have half a seat. SQ is one of the more expensive airlines these days - so expected a promise of a great flight and in-flight service and was looking forward to this trip as I was flying SQ after a very long time - never again if I can help it.","Product Review"
2016-07-17,"Bad online support, pretty bad food",4,"I booked my flight through a flight partner (Virgin Australia) and before this trip I didn't know how flight partners worked, all it did was give me a headache. I wanted to book in my seats, normally you can do that online, however I was unable to do so either through Virgin's website nor through Singapore Airline's. I called Virgin and they told me I need to speak with Singapore. I called Singapore and requested seats. That worked fine. However on the flight over I didn't realise that sitting right at the back was so noisy, I wore earplugs the whole flight and could still hear the noise, but that was fine, I learned my lesson, but when breakfast came, I was the very last person to be served they ran out of the edible meals and the other meal was some kind of fish (which smelled too strong for a confined space). I normally am one to enjoy all kinds of basic airplane food and am really not fussy, but this was too much. Fish (stinky) for breakfast? I actually was really unhappy because I never got a choice. Knowing all of this, I decided to change my flight home seat booking, so I wasn't the last person on the plane right down the back near all the noise. I emailed Singapore airlines with the request as soon as I landed. It took a couple weeks until they responded with a stock email saying I need to contact Virgin. I emailed back saying Virgin cannot do this as they dont have access to the seating plan, it is Singapore's job and I know as I have done it before. The email response that returned was the same stock email as they had sent again. This time I was really angry and re-iterated that they should PLEASE read the content of my email. Third time and I received the same exact response again. This was now 1 month after my original request (lucky I was away for 6 weeks). I had to find a way to call them while overseas (which was a who other headache...) because this was not being resolved online. So I called them and had a very long difficult conversation trying to get the guy to help me as he really wasn't actually listening to what I needed and I was getting frustrated. He finally put in the request for me to get the seats changed and when I told him about the food last time he said he could also request a no seafood meal. So I thought great, Ill do that. On my flight home, the seats were all good but this time I discovered that requesting a non seafood meal means that they dont give you any option at all whatsoever, you just get the rubber eggs, even when the meals being served are chicken or beef with no seafood options! When I asked if I get to choose the normal menu as it already is non seafood, I got an abrupt response about taking the meal from someone else. Gosh I had no idea about all this rubbish. So I learned a lot of things this flight. That Singapore Airlines have terrible online support and rubbish food and no matter what I did it didn't get better. I hear all these great things about Singapore and its probably fine if things are going ok for you but when they go wrong, they dont help you, not without a lot of effort and frustration any way. I will not be using them if I can help it, in the future. FYI I was going to make a complaint to them on their own site but after going through all I did with their online support last time I feel like its pointless and I am probably wasting my time as no one reads the emails (I can assume). Also remembered one more thing, on my flight back all the movies I tried to watch had Asian subtitles that were embedded in the movie (as in you couldn't turn them off) and as I had watched all the TV shows of interest 6 weeks prior on my way over and no new ones were on there. I really couldn't watch them because not only the subtitles were really distracting, the movies were also really low (low low) quality and to me they were unwatchable. Needless to say nothing went right for me on the flight with them.","Product Review"

2016-05-08,"8 hours without a meal!",2,"My experience with Singapore airlines was not good and I will never use them again. The service is very average and the meals (when you get them) are NOT good. I think when you are flying in economy you can't expect first class food but with Singapore they fed us when we got on the flight and then we waited 8-10 hours before receiving our next meal. Although they provided snacks in between it is not good enough. I don't know about you but eating biscuits and chocolate bars for 8 hours does not make you feel very good! I do have to give them some credit though as when we said we were starving they brought us a tiny bread roll each with more chocolate bars. If I can give Singapore Airlines any advise I would strongly suggest they have at least 3 proper meals for a 14 hour flight! 2 is not enough and having to deal with jetlag is bad enough, don't feed your guests crap so they feel even worse. We don't pay $1,000 a flight to have cold beef curry and chicken in some weird brown sticky sauce.","Product Review"

I have to say that ""Manage your Booking"" on their web site is absolutely hopeless. Sometimes it will accept the booking reference, and others not...and when you succeed, you do not always get all of the booking. Most annoying though is that part of their product offering for Premium Economy and above is ""Book the Cook""...but the most the web site allows is ""Standard Meal""...none of the advertised offerings under Book the Cook are available. Even more annoying, some weeks back I managed to use the ""old web"" site, and chose our meals. Now the old web site has been turned off, previous selections have disappeared....and we can't fix it. And there is more! You can only advise/complain about the situation via a online form which I have filled in days ago. I bet the response is never received. By the way, their smart phone App is equally useless. I am a Qantas Club member and am trying Singapore because they offer more suitable flights to Phuket and elsewhere.

2016-04-14,"Great service",10,"Booked Melbourne-Frankfurt flight with Lufthansa and ended up on Singapore Airlines on the Melbourne - Singapore leg which I didn't mind at all. Flew by myself with my 17 months old. On the way to Singapore all bassinets were booked so the lady at check in gave me a row of three seats without asking, so my son could sleep on the two vacant seats. I had booked a special meal for him which was served before mine, which was excellent so I could feed him before eating my meal. My son unfortunately discovered the call attendant button and kept pressing it but nobody was annoyed by it. They kept turning it off with a smile. On the way back we were given a bassinet which was handy. Everyone was again extremely nice and helpful, asking questions about my son. Again his meal was served before mine which was breakfast and just some jelly. The business class attendant came past and saw it and asked if a wanted a bread roll or toast instead for him. I agreed and she got him a roll. When he waz finished she came back, told the other staff to serve me my breakfast and she took him into business class so i could eat in peace. That was great customer service. Once in Melbourne we had to wait for our stroller, the whole cabin crew walked past us and kept waving to us and calling my son by his name which he loved and I appreciated. Again excellent customer service. Made my trip with a toddler by myself much easier. Greatly appreciated","Product Review"

I bet if Singapore Airline check with the staff, they will say its US$500 for all not per kg but hubby has confirm several time just in case he heard wrong and by the way its 6kg overweight so the math will not add up to US$500 too and no hand carry!!

They asked him to move his knees, he said ""No"" and then they told me (not asked me) to move to another seat - away from my husband. I asked if we could move to be together and was told ""No, you are the only one with the problem"" - unbelievable!! Also, my daughter, her husband and two children were recently on a flight to Japan when a drunk male passenger became loud and abusive and his language was disgusting. Several passengers asked the cabin crew to intervene and you know what they did? They left the cabin!! Some other male passengers then remonstrated with him to no avail. He carried on abusing everyone and still no sign of the cabin crew. They have absolutely no idea on how to deal with issues and have obviously had no training in this area at all. If you can't rely on the cabin crew to resolve issues then it makes for a frightening journey. The worst of it is that when I complained in writing about my experience the cabin crew lied. They said that they offered to move us both but that we declined, can you believe that? Of course not! Never again Singapore Airlines - you've just lost six frequent flyers!!!","Product Review"

My son fell on the first flight and bruised his face badly (not the airline's fault). The airline staff were very supportive and tried to accommodate us in every possible way, even at Singapore airport they asked if we were alright. We were able to change seats and meals were served when it was convenient for us. On the flight back we arrived at the airport with less than 40 min until departure due to unforeseen delays. The airline opened up the check in counter and did everything to get our luggage onto the plane in time; they remained very friendly despite us being so late. Overall, I received excellent service from them. The only thing they can improve is their phone line customer service. They did not answer the phone despite it being office hours and when my partner asked the Perth office to forward a message to the airline ground staff at Amsterdam airport they were very reluctant to do so.

Yet the airport boasts of providing a seamless transition for passenger with disabilities transiting at Changi. The publicity for the airport is obviously written by a young media savvy official who has looked at disability recommendations and written a web page saying the right things, but in fact the service element is non existent in reality.

2016-01-04,"Standard plummeted over the years...",4,"I've been flying SQ for the past 20 years and it's very sad to see Singapore's National Carrier decay in standard. Generally, I don't think there's much to complain about in service. It's dropped since the 90s, for sure but they started off with a very high standard to begin with and it's still miles ahead of other national regional carriers. I fly both Business and Economy and while the Business Class product generally has nothing to complain about, it's lost its ability to ""wow"". The flatbed is awesome but the service is beginning to tarnish. It used to be that a Sing-Beijing flight they'd serve 3 meals and you'd come off the plane a few kg heavier. Now a Sing-JFK flight and they serve the same # of meals and you feel it's a good weight loss programme. Recently (Nov 2015) took a flight back from Haneda to Singapore. Boarding was at 8:30AM and landed 4:30 Changi. To make an 08:30 flight you wake up at 5:30AM and get to the airport or 4:30AM Singapore time. Little chance to grab breakfast. For the entire 7 hour flight, they serve ONE meal, breakfast. Not even full meal, a very light breakfast (Croissant + eggs + beverage). There are some peanuts, etc. but only one meal. I told the chief steward how ridiculous this was. I informed him I was diabetic and he empathised but told me the meal plan and decisions to do so were set by HQ DESPITE feedback from them. I asked him if he thought it was reasonable and confidentially, he said the flight crew themselves bring something on-board to tied them over to 4:30PM. He was even kind enough to bring me a cup noodle around 2PM. I thanked him but asked him how did he think the other passengers felt about this meal plan.  So yes, I understand it's out of his hands but when did SQ decide to make such a glaring omission just to save on $$ and improve their return? How could ""The world's best airlines"" make this sort of mistake and despite feedback from customers and their aircrew, continue to perpetuate this mistake? I checked with my travel agency and it wasn't a crap class fare but full Economy class fare and it made me wonder how much profit does SQ require in its operations? The Flight load was near 100%, it looked like mainly people flying for business. There were some Japanese touristy looking passengers who might have been looking forward to the legendary ""SQ Service"". I'm pretty sure they came away underwhelmed and eager to publicise their experience through Social Media. It would be unfair to give SQ a 1 star rating when there are many other airlines deserving the ""terrible"" rating but the 2 star ""Bad"" rating is to signify the fall of SQ as a premier airlines. This is a bungling of management and they should be ashamed for the decay in standards and for falling so far short of the legacy they were left.","Product Review"

2015-12-08,"Disappointing",4,"After hearing how good Singapore Airlines are I booked my flights from Sydney -Singapore - Singapore - India - India - Singapore - Singapore -Sydney in November/December 2015. The first flight had us stacked in like sardines in a can so not a comfortable flight at all, leg room was terrible and to top it off I had a larger passenger over hanging my seat space. The second flight from Singapore to Delhi was ok. We flew three internal flights within India on Air India and Jet Airways with great leg room and service. On our homeward flight from Mumbai to Singapore our flight was delayed by nearly 6 hours - there was no information until you arrived at the gate ready for boarding - at this time the staff came around the air port and talked to people for the first time to make sure we were awake ready to make the flight. Singapore air lines provided a meal - the most disgusting food I have had, no choice at all, just a veg or non veg meal slapped on a plate with a cup of diet coke!!!!! The meal was some sort of chicken in terrible gravy with rice. I would have thought a meal voucher would have been more appropriate so you at least had a choice of what you wanted to eat instead of this unhealthy meal. This meal was fit only for the bin. The flight once we finally got on was ok as it was not full and we managed to get exit row seats so leg room was fine. The toilets smelled dirty, the air craft looked as if it was not well maintained as far as dirty walls down below - my screen was chipped and very tired. I won't be choosing Singapore airlines next time as I think they are letting their service slip because they have been top of the list for so long. There are many more carriers out there who have good reviews which I will be going to next time I fly.","Product Review"

They then said they could put me on a flight for the next day however they would not pay for my accommodation. So here I am stuck with the choice of taking the earlier flight and paying for a private boat or staying an extra night and paying for my accommodation. SQ would not compensate me and expects me to be out of pocket. I'm really disappointed at how u treat your customers.

Etickets was issued a day after booking and therefore made all other preparations and hotel booking. On 16/11/15 I received a text messages from SilkAir informing me that my return flight has been rescheduled from 06/12/15 to 04/12/15 and asked to contact my Travel Agent. No reason was given. My agent called me the same day but told me he could not help me because I had to return after 05/12/15 as my purpose of going there was to attend a wedding on 05/12/15 and therefore asked me to call SIA direct myself. I called SIA call centre the same day and was told that I could return on 08/12/15 and would reimburse my two days extended stay but told me that it had to be referred to the relevant Department for approval first and it would take one to two days. I was very happy and thanked that guy for kindly helping me. No reply was received after two days and I had to call again and was told I could fly on 08/12/15 but nil reimbursement would be given. Of course, I cannot accept the cost of my two additional days in Kuching so I asked them to find alternative solutions e.g. By Malaysian Airline flight on 06/12/15 even though I did not want it and paid more to fly SIA and SilkAir in the first place. After long arguments, I have been told that they would try to do it but would take 1 to 2 days. The two days expired 3 hours ago and I still have not heard from them. I am furious that my fully paid flights can be cancelled or rescheduled without my agreement. If this is to be rescheduled or cancelled by me, they would imposed huge penalty on me. Where is the fairness !!! I just cannot accept that this is the customer service of SIA. At this time of writing, I am still waiting for their call.

2015-11-12,"Just Horrible, Cheating And Disgusting.",2,"I still do not know why so many people extending 5 star to SIA. What I have been through in my last 3 flights to and from Perth was something horrible. I just do not know how to tackle this situation. It has become constant practice or SIA to behave disgusting with customers because they know nothing is going to loose their business because there are people who always need to fly. The Perth based customer service is just a stupid group of morons, who does not give a damn to any of your problems. They always keep you confined with endless issues and kept lingering on. After all my previous and horrible experiences with SIA just recently, I have booked SIA again because there is not enough connection available to the city I am travelling in South Asia. I already have booked my ticket online (using SIA website) have received an itinerary, but have not received the Eticket. The next morning when I called the customer service based in Perth, at first the lady was very abrupt and was treating me like [censored word removed]. She put me on hold three times for more than 8 minutes each. NO DRAMA. She told me hurriedly that the previous ticket booked is not available on her system however, she can view that a ticket was generated the previous under my name and she told me that it has been cancelled for some unknown reasons and money will be returned in 3-4 weeks. I have booked the ticket again, this time I have had received my eticket when again I called the customer service and, guess what when I explained about the previous so called cancelled ticket to this new customer care guy, he said YES< there is a confirmed ticket under my name, so now I have 2 tickets. What a drama. I can't believe that SIA is incorporating such malpractice and unfair business dealings with clients but now I am considering taking this matter to Consumer Protection Department. For me, this is just disgusting and sad too, coz I don't know how many people may be going through such horrible experiences. July 6th 2016 Update: Seriously rotten staff and cheap customer service After submitting my last review please consider this one as part 2 of the previous version. Perhaps the incident occurred at the Perth international airport terminal and just outside the Singapore airlines boarding gate is so painful and disturbing which has actually affected my overall health and mental status. Whilst I was ready to board on my flight to Singapore on the 11th of January 2016 in the morning I was carrying an extra air bag with me. This bag I thought to carry with me alongside my laptop bag which was a small laptop bag. When they announced the boarding, passengers started moving towards the gate ready to show their boarding passes. I also queued and started walking slowly towards the boarding gate staff. Once I reached at the counter to show my boarding pass one of the Singapore airlines staff virtually snatched away the boarding pass and shouted at me, what's the weight of this extra bag? Sounds like they were keeping an eye onto me. I simply said that it may weight approx 8kgs? Then that guy who has beard called other people using his radio and they all took me aside shouting at me. Imagine my situation that everyone has gathered me from all around and have grabbed my bag. Somebody is saying so who is going to pay for your extra luggage? I did not say anything. They one guy took away my laptop bag by force and weighs this.......shouted from a far....this bag is 9 KGS. Then another lady came and said straight away, either you pay extra for this bag, throw away few things or else we are going to cancel your boarding pass right now. She also threatened me that I will have to miss this flight and go back if I have not paid the amount immediately. In that situation I was just shocked and started throwing out so many things from that bag.....as I have few make up kits for my little sister's marriage and few other things..... believe me or not I have emptied half of the things from the bag within few minutes. Imagine my situation that I was virtually sobbing in tears begging them to please help me but instead tbey kept humiliating and insulting me. Finally. Everything was happening before hundreds of passengers at the airport but no one came forward even to ask them to behave. Finally they charged me $650 approximately and allowed me to board the flight. They also took away my other bag which was not even locked. Upon arrival on the destination I found that the other bag seal which was a simple one found broken and so many of valuable gifts are missing. As I have to participate in my sister's marriage I did not let my parents knew about this incident. A new mini iPad, a Samsung Galaxy 4, a Gucci ladies watch all gone. Perhaps the SIA people targeted me after going through my first review before this new one. I m not worried about whatever I have been through but imagining a similar situation makes me feel horrible and stressed that I can't believe. I already have decided to take this matter to appropriate government body not only to get justice but also to uncover those people who have humiliated and insulted me. Friends I just am not biased with SIA but whatever happened with me has made my life just painful and horrible. Thank you all for taking time in reviewing this article.","Product Review"

2015-11-05,"Premium Disappointment",2,"Earlier this year Singapore Airlines introduced Premium Economy (PE) class to flights from Singapore to Frankfurt. So I booked PE on one leg of the flight and paid. Weeks later I learned that PE would not be available on my flight. The airline did not reimburse me and also did not want to book me onto a different flight where PE seats were available. I was offered a voucher instead to do my own upgrading with, on a different part of the flight. The voucher never arrived. In six phone conversations in as many weeks, I was told each time that the voucher had been posted. It still did not arrive. Searching the internet for similar cases I learned that customers who suffered the same fate received their vouchers one day before departure. With PE seats always booked out well in advance those vouchers were useless. After two more weeks and further pleading with the airline to either reimburse me or use the money to upgrade me to PE on another leg of my flight, the answer was still the same: they can't reimburse or upgrade me, because a voucher has/will be sent. I kept calling and insisted to either receive a voucher via email or an upgrade while I waited on the phone. After putting me on hold for 45 minutes, they agreed to upgrade me. For me, booking the new PE with Singapore Airlines was premium disappointment. It took 2 months and a lot of stress to finally just get what I had paid for.

Time and time again they provided very lousy service: (1) the staff spoke with heavy Indian accent, which I could barely understood. (2) very dull voice and mumbling throughout the conversation (3) were not understanding the price structure and could not answer my questions about the price difference between online price and her price. Eventual I called Melbourne office and their price matched internet price, which is $180 cheaper than the Indian call centre's quote. I wrote to Singapore Airlines 6 months ago about this. None has been changed. Very disappointing! They seem to forget about customer impression's touch points that [Name removed] consulted them!","Product Review"

2015-10-27,"Fantastic flight and service",8,"First time on Singapore Airlines was in November 2014 and was very impressed with the service and professionalism and the friendly flight attendants. But what I found was the Next Gen economy seats on the 777 aircraft, they are very uncomfortable and I could not sit on it any longer than 5hours without a sore bum. I would fly Singapore Airlines but I won't fly on the 777 Next Gen seats. Sorry Singapore Airlines but get those horrible seats recushioned. How could anyone make an airline seat with such bad cushioning, the next gen seats are supposed to give you more personal space which it does and heaps of leg space but the down fall is the part your backside sits on, it makes your back side painfully sore after around 5-6 hours of sitting on them. i found even after i got up to move around for awhile then return to the seat i could not even sit on the seat. i can fly for 14 hours without moving from my seat normally but not with the next gen seats. Come on Singapore Air i would love to fly on your airline as the service and entertainment systems were great but i can not sit on those next gen seats. all they need is extra padding on the cushion as the rest of the seat is great. Just a tweak to get it perfect and you will have the best seat in the economy class. Service impeccable, 777 er300 seats bad.","Product Review"

No accommodation was offered. We were told if we wanted food (having missed out on dinner) to walk back to Burger King (almost a kilometre) and present our Boarding Passes for S$15 worth. As I'd caught a Euro bug and was feeling sick, & have hip and back problems I did not wish to walk to Burger King, as such food would have made me sicker. A single skimpy blanket eventually arrived after several requests. Other food arrived at 4.30 am after one was obliged to attempt sleep on a metal airport lounge. Not good for a painful back.

They would have been in trouble at the airport, not being able to travel as planned!  This Singapore airlines is also causing inconvenience to me by asking me go to their office again tomorrow to get it all fixed before they can travel.

Usually, they act fast and provide the passenger the best solution with good explanation and consideration. I experience just couple days ago. I missed my baggage. It is sure a long flight and 2 times transit I admitted. The first itinerary was from Surabaya to Singapore then Dubai by SQ and connected to FlyDubai from Dubai to Muscat. The SQ counter at Surabaya confirmed that they could manage baggage with FlyDubai. It was smoothly done. But, when I flee back from Muscat to Dubai by FlyDubai FZ038 on 31stJul2015 and connected to SQ495 same day, FlyDubai also confirmed that my baggage could be managed until last destination, Surabaya. At Dubai, when I checked in to get my boarding pass, I informed the lady at Transfer Desk B my baggage tag, and she said confirmed until Surabaya. Then upon arriving at Surabaya, I couldn't find my baggage and there was no any notification at all. Until the last bag came out, I could not find it. I checked with lost and found, they helped to recheck all the baggage there, but couldn't find and filed a report. They said tomorrow morning after SQ land, I will get the information. But on tomorrow morning, I did not get any information and I had to call to ask, which said wait until afternoon. In the afternoon, i was called and informed that my baggage was left over at Dubai with unknown reason! They will try to arrange back. So, who has bad service? Why there is no notification to the passenger? After day 3 only the bag is delivered and but it was delivered to me on almost at midnight time 23:30, they woke me up. They rang the door bell, they called to my mobile, then home phone just to wake me up and pick up the baggage.

Seat space appears better than on many airlines and seats are reasonably comfortable with provided pillows and blankets. Hot towels provided several times during the flights are comforting and refreshing. Entertainment options are extensive and provide good distraction for those who can not sleep in a sitting up position - even with some recline. Food is adequate, fresh and tasty with a range of snacks available in between meals on extra long flights ( Singapore to Europe). Drink options are plentiful and crew circulate frequently during the flights with trays of juice or water.

I rang up the reservation line and spoke to the person, everything was good and trying to do the right thing. When I arrived at the airport, nothing was done and it was as if I did not make any reservation at all. This has happened to me 3 times on 3 different flights. I will not fly with Singapore airlines if there is another direct flight from another airlines. I have no choice as it is much easier with direct flight when travelling with young child. I will suggest people with children or need assistance to consider other airlines than Singapore airlines as they are not as helpful as what they used to be and boast to be.

2015-07-31,"Most horrible flight experience ever",2,"I come to Singapore Airline for it's reputation of luxury. Yep, it's great during flight, but not if you got kicked out of the cabin. I took flights from London to Singapore, then to Sydney. In London, the ground crew claimed he can check in all the flights for me once and selecting seats as well. We accepted, Why not? Nightmare begins, Singapore counter said the check in is not confirmed, (we heard of some computer glitch, but fixed). Then they issue us with the unwanted middle seats. They even threaten me for won't go back to Australia for the next 2 weeks if we don't accept the boarding pass. Alright, let's discuss with the flight attendants and gate officer. Now they gave us the ""Best Customer Service EVER"".  Gate officer told me to get out of the plane and arrange my next flight. Easy? They close the door immediately when I'm out. What is going on? Now the gate officer gone wild saying ""I DON'T WANT TO SEE SUCH A TROUBLE PASSENGER DON'T WANT TO BOARD THE PLANE, AT MY GATE!"" Now I'm charged with $200 USD for ""missing the flight for own reasons"". All I have done is following ""orders"" of the crews. All the crews 'answer is ""just email a complaint."" I mean seating is such an easy problem to solve. I have never had any problems with Qantas, Cathay, Virgin. Give us upgrades or just find a good pair of seats or even just ask the passengers would like a swap. Dead simple, but Singaporean doesn't have the brain power to think of. Would never consider Singapore and the whole country, despite I have spent over 2000 bucks and this crap country and airline. P.s. Sorry for I can't provide the original boarding pass as evidence as the angry ground crew tore it to pieces. I hope I can record the whole process which is definitely shocking, but that's not possible due to my concern of safety and the possibility of being arrested. Just take Qantas or Cathay.","Product Review"

2015-07-22,"Appalling customer service",2,"I am in utter shock at the appalling customer service by this supposedly world class airline. In brief, I had an important work event to attend in Barcelona so I purposely chose Singapore Airines due to their apparent good reputation. Never again. I flew from Melbourne to Barcelona via Singapore, and my baggage never arrived. I understand these things happen. I was given 60 euro after a lot of hassle and sent on my way. I was without any clothes, work documents, toiletries etc but again, I did not directly blame the airline. I was just very unlucky. I had to spend a lot of money, and use valuable time, buying appropriate attire. During this time I could not get through to Singapore Airlines regarding my bag or status of compensation, despite repeated phone calls and messages. I then proceeded to Ireland on holidays for 2 weeks, where my bag turned up 4 days before I left to return to Australia. My issue is that this happened months ago and I have been passed back and forth by Singapore Airlines customer service without any real responses into my claim for compensation. I am not asking for much, just to be reimbursed for expenses as I am entitled to. I cannot get responses from them and am ignored for weeks. I suppose they hope I will just go away. Some advice, if you want reliability and to be able to actually get a response from customer service when things go wrong, do not fly with Singapore Airlines.

2015-06-09,"My vote for consistent Service",8,"As a frequent traveler I generally choose SQ as my preferred carrier. I find that they provide the most consistent service and nearly always get all the service basic's right. I find SQ staff engage with passengers pleasantly and efficiently throughout the flight and are generally attentive and accommodating. I have flown other carriers including more recently Qantas, Jetstar (Shudder), Emirates, Virgin (my preferred domestic carrier these days), Air France, Scoot, Ryanair, Malaysian and Vietnam Airways and I will grant that most of these also do the basics well enough. Having said that I have had good and not so good with all of the above and have found Qantas very hit and miss over the last few years, which is a shame. I also flew on an Emirates 777 had the hardest seats I think I've ever sat on, thank god it was only 4 hours. I'd still also rank Malaysian as a pretty good airline despite their unfortunate present situation. Not to say SQ are perfect as I've also had hit and misses with Singapore but with SQ its generally very infrequent, so its the consistency that wins out for me. I also find Changi airport is a pleasant hub and the SQ aircraft are clean, appear to be well maintained and cabin staff are usually very good at service delivery throughout. Points are also available for the Velocity program which helps too. My most recent trip was LON to SYD via Changi and the service on both legs was pleasant and attentive for such a long flight. Enjoyed that we also got to experience the economy section on the upper deck of the 380. Its amazing that we can get from one side of the planet to the other these days in less than 24 hours and I think many travelers sort of forget what an feat of organisation it is, for any airline, to safely move so many people to so many distant destinations on a daily basis. Yes mistakes with bags happen, schedules conflict or connections are missed and the tasty vegan meal you ordered, well isn't, but if you expect these things will happen from time to time and prepare a little for it then the pain nearly always goes away :) I guess the secret to long distance and regular (or irregular) travel is to look for consistency but still allow some time for contingencies, always be insured and learn to practice a little patience. Enjoy your travels and I hope this helps a little in your choices...","Product Review"

2015-06-01,"Singapore Air Does Not Correct It's Mistakes",2,"Please note feedback given to Singapore Air below: Update 6/1/15 I checked with Virgin Australia Airlines (Singapore Air partner who this flight was originally booked with) yesterday and was told there were multiple flights out of Sydney with open seats for the dates I requested. Clearly Singapore Air was less than honest with me again, I have been told by your staff over and over again that there were no flights. Because there aren't many seats left, I am running out of time to get my trip back on track, and you haven't replied in 48 hours I will be booking my own Virgin flight out of Sydney and will be expecting Singapore Air to cover it's $500 cost as well as refund my $150 excess baggage fee for the bag you misplaced IF I don't receive a reply from you in the next 2 hours. To Whom It May Concern: This is in reference to booking confirmation #: 5XM77U My experience with Singapore Airlines has been absolutely awful this trip, your airline has gone downhill since the last time I used it 7 years ago. During the first leg of my trip I have experienced very unprofessional business practices, dishonesty, and poor customer service. Singapore has destroyed the first leg of my trip in Australia. Here are the issues I've encountered thus far: Â·  Due to poor and unprofessional check in procedures at SFO I nearly missed my flight. I was told that they could not charge my credit card for excess baggage fees at the check in counter due to a system change and that they would have to run my credit card upstairs. After 30 minutes I expressed concern about the delay and it potentially causing me to miss my flight and I was told they were almost done, another 15 minutes lapsed. I expressed concern again and requested my credit card back, they refused to return my credit card and claimed that my boarding pass could not be issued until my credit card was charged. Shortly after I was informed that everything was complete, my boarding pass was stamped priority, and I was promised access to the Singapore Air lounge to get some quick drinks and food because the delays made it impossible for me to purchase some before my flight. When I went to the location where I was told the Singapore Air lounge existed, there was no lounge. I know I was in the right place because I was told it was near the boarding gate. When I asked merchants in the area I was told there was no Singapore Air lounge in the vicinity. Aside from causing me to nearly miss my flight, it is extremely strange, unprofessional, unreasonable, and makes me very uncomfortable that somebody disappears with my credit card for over 45 minutes. I have this well documented, if there are inappropriate charges on my card Singapore Air will be held accountable. So due to disorganization, poor process, and unprofessional business practices I almost missed my flight, my credit card may have been misused, and I was lied to about the lounge. In addition to wasting inordinate amounts of my vacation time to get this straightened out here are the issues I've encountered thus far: Â·  Part of my baggage was transferred from Singapore to Munich, Germany rather than Sydney, Australia (baggage claim ref#SYOSQ35806). Then to make matters worse they failed to deliver the bags to my address in Australia on the night of May 27 as promised. As a result I had to cancel a trip down the coast with 4 of my Australian friends who all had taken time off from work. And it ruined my travel plans to Melbourne Australia. Â·  Yesterday, May 29th I spent 4 hours on the phone with your Sydney reservations team trying to change my booking to fly out of Sydney on an earlier date rather than Melbourne on June 7 as per my itinerary. The first 2 hours I dealt with people whom I could barely understand and who clearly didnâ€™t know how to do their jobs, they couldnâ€™t locate my flight based on any of the information I had available. Finally I got through to somebody who located my flight but was informed that there were no available flights out of Sydney and they were not authorized to upgrade my class or do anything else to secure me a flight out of Sydney. I was given multiple numbers to call to get this resolved and all of them claimed that they had no authorization Â·  Today, May 30th I call the Sydney reservations team and get the same story but was givcn an email address to escalate this issue but told that the escalation team was not working until Monday. Had I been told yesterday, May 29th how to escalate this I could have sent an email mid day and potentially resolved it same day. Now I am being told I can book and pay for a flight to Melbourne to catch my originally booked flight. Because my travel plans to Melbourne were destroyed I no longer need to be in Australia after my friends wedding today and will incur additional expenses to stay, does it make sense to you that I have to incur additional expense due to a mistake by Singapore Airlines? At this point, I am expecting Singapore Airlines to get me to Denpasar, Bali Indonesia as soon as possible and/or cover the expenses I incur for spending additional time in Australia when I no longer need to. It is also inexcuseable that a customer would have to deal with such a beauracuracy trying to get an issue resolved. If this does not get resolved quickly and/or it still wastes inordinate amounts of my time I can assure you that my wife and I will NEVER do business with Singapore Air again, and we fly USA to Indonesia twice per year, and we will make sure that all of our friends and family who fly frequently donâ€™t use Singapore Air. I will also post my experience online so that word gets out about it and will be seeking compensation in court when I return to the USA. At this point itâ€™s up to you how this ends, act quickly and find an acceptable, fair, and reasonable solution for the situation and I can let it go. Donâ€™t take responsibility for resolving the situation quickly and Iâ€™ve told you what I will do. After my friends goes on his honeymoon today the email address herein will be the only way to reach me.","Product Review"
2015-05-15,"SIA taking advantage of disabled passengers",2,"I helped my 88 year old mother and blind sister to book 2 seats from Sydney to Penang on 26 April 2015 for SIA SQ232 departing on 3rd of May 2015. Their booking number was 431WBZ Both of them need to sit together as my elderly mother visually guides my blind sister. They then proceeded to look for 2 preferred seats that were side by side. When the cabin layout appeared on the computer screen, there was only one location on the cabin seating plan where there were two seats side by side. The rest of the preferred seats were single seats. They assumed that this was a full flight and paid for these 2 seats that were side by side, 54J and 54H. When they clicked the two seats, there was NO indication / comment on the cabin seating plan itself that these 2 seats were only for able bodied English speaking passengers. I then booked two wheel chairs for them. The SIA officer checked their seat bookings and told me that both of them will be by taken by wheelchairs / mobility aids from the Sydney SIA check in counter to their 54J and 54H seats. He said that everything was in order and that he would generate a request to SIA in Sydney. When they tried to check in at SIA in Sydney, they were told that they cannot have their 54J and 54J seats and that they cannot have a refund of $103, the amount that they paid for these 2 seats. This represents poor customer service by SIA and shows how SIA has exploited two vulnerable passengers. They obviously would not have paid for seats they could not use. My representations to SIA supervisors in Sydney and numerous phone calls to SIA overseas had no effect. Post script When I posted the note above on SIAâ€™s Facebook page, SIA sent me the cabin seating plan in a pdf file that appeared on their computer booking screen to argue their case that these two passengers did not read the instructions on the cabin seating plan. (http://www.singaporeair.com/pdf/seatmaps/airbus380.pdf). As you can see from this SIA provided plan, there are no notifications on the seating plan as to who can use them. When the booking was done for these two seats, there were a number of single seats scattered throughout the cabin with the capital letter P attached to them, not just those on the exit points. I mentioned this to SIA and was asked to fill in a customer feedback form, this request comes after having made numerous phone calls overseas and having received a credit refusal email from SIA. How much feedback does SIA want about its customer care towards disabled passengers ?","Product Review"

I followed up with phonecalls (over one hour on the phone) to confirm. Was glad when they confirmed it was all sorted. On check-in, the CONFIRMED seat was not available. No window seat was available! My child spent the flight vomiting over and over and over. Thankfully it disrupted the staff too as on the other end I followed-up with Singapore customer service and despite email records AND phone records, Singapore Airlines just LIED and said the conversations never took place. I even had the reference number and the names of the people I spoke to! THEN they cracked a brand new (expensive) suitcase. The main body of the suitcase is cracked as they must have dropped something heavy onto it. Singapore are the most deceitful company I have ever come across as they allege that the main body of the suitcase is a protruding section and therefore they do not cover this damage. The suitcase was new and now is unuseable! It wasn't a protruding section - they couldn't be bothered to look!! NEVER EVER AGAIN! These people are BULLIES and should not be allowed to even operate given their dishonest behaviour. Imagine how bad their aviation safety is when they lie about something as simple as a seat request which is clearly documented. Scary stuff! NEVER EVER AGAIN!!","Product Review"

2014-12-05,"One of the best airline for a long-haul trip, including the transit at Singapore T3",10,"Recently flew with SQ from Sydney to Barcelona, and Paris to Sydney, all via T3 in Singapore. Personally Singapore is a much better transit airport vs. Doha (we flew with Qatar last year). All flawless, no issues, truly enjoyed the Singapore sling on deck. On one of the flight segment, the flight attendant kept coming back and asking if we would like another one (yes, please!). Also, on the first leg, there was a 1-hour delay with a storm in Sydney airport. Ground staff, including manager, and flight attendant came around and offered all passengers a drink (water & OJ). They do try to make the best out of any unfortunate situation. Not the cheapest, but for me on a long-haul flight to Europe, they will be my #1 choice. Also, somehow i prefer their old economy seats than the new one as it provides marginally more legroom!","Product Review"

2014-12-02,"What a Bully!",2,"I had my parents come over to Australia from overseas for few weeks. Flight to Australia was flawless however, leaving Australia was just horrible. The check in agent in Brisbane was rude and very inconsiderate. My parents are in their 60s, they have traveled in the past and are not first-time travelers. Despite my mom having a bad knee and my dad possessing a deteriorating ankle, we did not request for special service because they could still walk, we would rather have someone else who really needs the service use it. Prior to their flight, we weighed, checked and re-checked their luggage. I also read the baggage allowance guide in the Singapore Airlines' website (singaporeair.com/en_UK/travel-information/baggage-allowances/) to make sure that their luggage complies with the rules. I checked my parents in online prior to arriving at the airport. My parents were entitled to 30 kgs of luggage each so a total of 60kgs for both (and according to SIA's website, luggage must not exceed 32 kgs each). At the airport, one of my parents' luggage was 31 kgs and the other was 29 kgs, the check in agent told my parents that this was unacceptable eventhough both still weighed 60 kgs in total. She would only accept baggage not exceeding 30 kgs each. She told my parents that they either have to pay 1 kg in excess or transfer the 1 kg to the other bag. My parents ended up transferring the 1 kg to the other bag despite the information on SIA's website that must not exceed 32 kgs NOT 30 kgs). My parents were also both entitled to a carry on luggage (7 kgs in weight) with the sum of length, width and height of each piece not exceeding 115 cm. The check in agent totally picked on my parents because she also disallowed the carry on luggage that my parents were carrying at the time because she thinks it was too big, without even measuring it, I have used the same luggage as carry on (both in international and domestic flights) in the past and never had issues. There were other passengers who had luggage bigger than what my parents had. I measured the luggage and the sum was not even 100 cm. It would even fit an Airbus 320's overhead bin. Lucky that my parents had an extra bag, so they removed all the contents of that carry on luggage and transferred everything in their extra bag. What's more ridiculous is that while waiting for boarding, the same check in agent used the airport's intercom to page my parents to report to wherever she was (after customs and immigration) just to make sure that they got rid of their previous carry on. Now, that's what I call power tripping. Didn't she have anything better to do than to bully my parents? Weren't they busy enough? Remember, these are two old people in their 60s, one with a bad knee and the other with an ankle injury. If you do not want yourself or someone you care about be disrespected and discriminated, do not fly this airline. That being said, I will never, for the life of me, fly this airline, nor will any of my family. I will also encourage friends and family to avoid this airline. There are better airlines out there who would treat you and anyone you care about with respect and as equal. This is blatant discrimination.","Product Review"

2014-10-14,"DISHONEST AIRLINES WITH NO CARE AND RESPECT FOR ELDERLY PASSENGERS",2,"I booked Singapore Airlines for my parents from New Delhi to Sydney and also asked for Assistance. The ground assistance in staff told them that their flight was delayed so the next connecting flight to Sydney has already left. Their only option is to board the next flight to Bali and then to Sydney. I called Singapore Airlines office and explained them that my father has a medical condition so please try to adjust him to next direct flight to Sydney rather than sending to Bali. The customer service rep put me on a long wait and then came back with an explanation that flight was not delayed as confirmed by staff in Delhi. I then asked him to explain why Ground Assistance staff then told my parents and 2 other old ladies about missing the connecting flight. Also, why were they given a food voucher? He simply disconnected me. I think that Singapore to Sydney flight was fully booked out so they tricked the old passengers by lying to them and letting them take alternate longer routes. Upon reaching Bali, the Ground staff asked my parents to apply for a VISA. Thank God I gave my father a roaming SIM. I had to spend so much time to explain them that they are not going out but flying to Sydney. The staff had no clue why they even arrived in BALI. What a SHAMEFUL ACT FROM SINGAPORE AIRLINES.

2014-08-16,"One of the best airlines - Singapore Air!!!",10,"I've been flying with Singapore Airlines since 2007 (SYD-SIN-MNL). I can't find any faults with this airline. The seats were comfortable and spacious specially on the SYD-SIN flight they use A380 which has a huge monitor with a wide range of entertainment choices from games, music, documentary, tv shows, movies and international films. The service is great with unlimited drinks - coffee, tea, juice, soda, cocktails, wine and spirits. Food is also tasty and satisfying. Upon arriving in Changi Airport, the aiport itself is very huge and clean, there were a lot of activities to do which makes the lay over not so boring, there's a wide range of shopping areas/duty free, garden, pond, butterfly garden, entertainment, restaurants and lounges. On December 07, 2013 me and my friend were upgraded to Business Class seats due to the airline being fully booked. Since we were a KrisFlyer Member they gave us the best seats on the SIN-MNL bound flight. It was an amazing experience (it was our first time on a business class seats!) The food is even better served on a 3 course meal, senior flight steward/stewardess were assisting the passengers on the business class and were very attentive of our needs. Upon take-off we can't even hear the planes engine roaring or can't even feel the plane ascending. Overall Singapore Airlines is one of the best airlines!","Product Review"

If you have the chance, go Qatar or even Qantas",2,"Please, first, allow me to establish a baseline to be fair: I traveled long distances, over 10 hours trips, and through Business class on all companies I will mention about here. I will start from the most important message, based on my experience and opinion, if you can, avoid Singapore Airlines Business. There are a plenty of other companies willing to give you more by the same price. 1st - the airplanes are old, pretty old (all of them). I got 4 different Singapore flights before to publish this. 2nd - Believe or not but not all Singapore Business seats completely recline (180 degrees). 3rd - The cabin crew is not really polite and attentive. 4th - the food options are minimum. I never thought, before Singapore experiences, that I would leave a business class flight with severe Back Pain and hungry. Yes, Hungry - there were only 3 options of food at Business and for my lucky, I didn't like any of them. To me, comparing orange with oranges, Qatar is currently the Best Air Company in the World. I could expend lines and lines writing about the amazing brand new airplanes, immaculate on board service and food. Qantas was not bad too.

There was not enough appropriate kids shows and the food was average. The cabin crew were not as attentive as last time, maybe as the flight was full. On the positive side, its the shortest travel time between Sydney and London. Was given a privilege pass at Sydney which was great for the kids not queuing up for too long.

A week later when they answered the phone I gave them the details and they said they had it and to come pick it up. I went to international airport on the same day and after half an hour they could not find it but the manager took my name and number and told me he would call me back later that day. Never heard from him again. Three days later on a Monday I emailed both Singapore Airlines and Toll Dnata explaining my situation. Singapore rang me a few hours later and gave me a ridiculous excuse that the laptop had been sitting for too many months. Wrong, I have their first email sent to my friend and that was end of February. The lady told me her supervisor only had the key to the cabinet and when she is in tomorrow she will call me. The next day she rang me to pick it up and told me to bring the emails with me. and I went. Upon arrival I had to show my licence and also forwarded the emails form my friend requesting me to pick up and original Singapore emails to the lady at Sydney International Airport Singapore Offices on Level 3. After all that she then told me that she would not release the laptop to me because I do not have a printed authorisation paper. I emailed Singapore through their website complaining about this runaround and continual misinformation provided by Singapore which has caused me to take 2 days off work at financial loss to myself and then pay for parking at the airport only to get no where by following exactly what Singapore told me.

Never mind that, I think pervasive racism occurred. As most passengers were from Hong Kong, I notice the lack of smiles and good will that is usually Singapore Airlines. Most cabin members were rather brusque! My connecting flight from Singapore to Perth (SQ 225) on the same night was what Singapore Airlines has always been - simply, a great way to fly.

They have an option called the 'Prefered Seating Option' to allow passangers to choose their desired seat at an additional fee. I was taken aback at the fact that they make you pay to choose your seat when other asian carriers don't charge a cent to pick your seat during check in! It was like some budget airline! I had no choice as I had read many reviews regarding the poor seats on this airline so I paid and booked an aisle seat using their shocking website. On the day of departure, I went to check in and was given my ticket by some rude and tired ground staff. The seat on the ticket didn't correlate to the seat I had booked. I was dumped in a seat right up on the window towards the end of the plane. I approached the staff very nicely about this issue but they gave me a sigh and told me I should have checked in earlier then they could have sorted this out! Unbelievable! Yes I had arrived at the airport a little later than I normally do as I had paid for the seat that I wanted so there was no need for me to rush! The staff made this issue my problem when their system is a total mess! They didn't bother listening and I ended up on some of the most uncomfortable flights I have experienced in my years of flying. Why call it the ""prefered seating option"" if they won't even deliver it? Just another way of scamming passengers...

After coming back I sent a email to Singapore airlines and got a following funny reply ""I would like to share that our investigations show that a technical glitch had been present in our Reservations system. On this occasion, while passengers were able to select the seat at the point of booking, the glitch allowed for other passengers to select bassinet points as well even though they had been taken up. As such, the bassinet seat was on a pending basis and had not been confirmed eventually. I understand that you had approached our ground staff in Singapore for their assistance in confirming your bassinet seat requests. I note that our staff had affirmed that the bassinet seats were confirmed. However, your return flight on SQ217, the seat was on a pending basis as well. Furthermore, please be assured that our IT department is aware of the glitch and they are working closely with our vendors to rectify the defect.

The service from Singapore Airlines was excellent. I am surprised by some of the preceding trivial complaints; people forget that the main purpose of the cabin crew is to ensure the safety of those onboard they are not waiters and waitresses although they do this very well also. I noted that the cabin crew were very particular with checking seat belts, baggage on the floor, window shades and seat backs. The A380 was impressive and surprisingly quiet. The seat pitch was as good as any other economy seat on other airlines. The 777 was a bit noisier but no more so than other airlines 777s. The food was great and we found tasty choices on each sector. The entertainment system was great with a huge choice of movies, TV, games, flight watch etc. Our kids were very well looked after with small size headsets and free gifts with games and colouring in pencils. We were very lucky to have smooth flights even with thunderstorms and lightning visible at times. No wonder they are rated the #3 Airline in the world 2012.","Product Review"
2013-05-03,"Good airline - Old Aircrafts",6,"I had a family trip to India via Singapore with a 4 year old daughter and 1 year old twin boys recently in Feb 2013. I find the service good and they looked after us really well. I had booked the tickets through an agent however I had no issues confirming bassienet seats online for all the travel legs. Onboard the flight attendants catered well. We had pre-requested meals so the food was good and edible. They also provided milk for boys when at one instance they refused to drink formula. Ground staff at Sydney was very help too. The only problem is that their aircrafts are really old, seats uncomfortable and entertainment unites sometmes do not work. Their aircraft is very untidy too and especially the remote control seems like it was never wiped once installed. During turbulance the aircraft rattled very badly on the inside that i once felt it is literally going to split open. I would have rated this review good if their aircrafts were much cleaner and seats more comfortable","Product Review"
2013-04-12,"Bullied by Singapore Airline Ground Staff",2,"We were 3 adult passengers and an infant travelling from Bangalore to Brisbane via Singapore. We were carrying with us 3 pieces of handbags and an extra bag with infants food, filtered & bolied water as the infant had issues with water in her Singapore Airlines flights earlier in the month which made her sick for a week, change of clothes her napkins etc.. So, in total, we had 4 bags for the 4 passengers. We passed the security without any problems but were stopped and advised by one of SIA ground staff (Mr. [name removed] is what he was referred to by the other staff) that we could not take the extra bag for the infant and we could carry only 2 pieces of hand luggage on the flight as cabin luggage for the 4 passengers. The infant handbag consisting all the infant's meals and other requirements needed to be checked-in as also will my handbag as they do not allow infant any hand baggage allowance. The ground staff hurried us up and was tagging the 2 baggages to be sent along with the check-in luggages while I was still protesting. It was only upon my mother's repeated pleading to the staff that they considered letting the infant's bag in. The flight wasnt even full and had many seats vacant so space wasnt the issue. We have requested SIA for an explanation of this behaviour by their ground staff but havent received any response from them. International Airlines like SIA can have their way these days as there are no channels to escalate these issues to in most countries including Australia. I have been flying SIA for the last 13 years and will now consider other airlines and so will my family and friends.","Product Review"

2013-03-18,"Worst long-haul flight ever",2,"Flew from Singapore to Frankfurt on board an absolutely ancient Boeing 777 which was not just old (that I can cope with) but which was filthy dirty. The carpets are shabby, there are dirty marks everywhere and it just feelsl ike it hasn't been cleaned for years. For a 13-hour flight this makes you wonder if it is so terrible on the surface, what the quality is like of the aircraft below the surface. We had terrible turbulence across India, the Stans and, in fact, for around 8 hours of the 13-hour flight. Yet, it felt like the plane was flying on autopilot with the pilots asleep as they did not give us any information the whole flight - not about the route, the weather, why it was so bumpy, and they certainly didn't try to shift altitude (we were just at 9,700 meters) during the turbulence to make it more comfortable for passengers. To make matters worse, the crew are absolutely unfriendly with very poor English. I had a sick stomach and needed something to settle it - as I was vomiting for half of hte flight ... all they could offer me was water with lemon, hot chocolate or Rennie's, nothing else ... even the water came back up. During the worst of the turbulence, I felt like the plane was going to break in half - such an old vintage machine should not be allowed to fly such long flights. All in all, I would never fly with Singapore Airlines again - they are completely overrated regarding their service and standards. I did not feel safe or comfortable the entire flight and just wanted to get off the plane. Better to fly with Lufthansa's new and professional crew on the A380 on this route. Just watch though as they can codeshare sometimes with Singapore Airlines and I wouldn't wish this flight with SIA on anyone else. To top it all off, the crew dance around in Asian style flowery costumes but they are so unfriendly compared to other Asian airlines and their English is horrific. They keep coming around with hot towels etc but I'd prefer less time spent on these stupid superficial details and a better aircraft and a more safe and relaxing flight. And to make matters even worse, if you have an 8-hour stopover in Singapore, the business (i.e. Gold class) lounge just sucks ... there is no quiet relax area, the toilet is 200 meters outside the lounge, there are no showers and the food choice is terrible. . Never again!","Product Review"

I went to do exactly the same thing a week later and was told i would have to take my credit crad to the nearest Singapore Airline office for verification before he would be allowed to fly. When i questioned this i was told that was the way it was. So i said i wanted to cancel the flight and we would book via Emirates. He said it was a non rewfundable airfare and my card would be charged! I said how come you can charge my card when i want to cancel, but you cant use my card to pay for the flight. After 45 minutes on the phone he agreed to let me email him the form with ID. He could have suggested that in 5 minutes and saved us all a lot of time. I have since had another two call to them each nearly half an hour. I have never had these problems with Qantas or Emirates and will give them preference next time.","Product Review"

2012-11-06,"Excellent",10,"I travelled business class to UK in June 2012 with Singapore Airlines, I was travelling alone and having arthritis there were many things the staff assisted me with which I simply could not have managed on my own - assistance with luggage and practical assistance on the plane. They were attentive and bright in both directions. Airport lounges were excellent though at heathrow there was a different lounge being used temporarily due to some maintenance or something, ok but not up to the same standard as the other lounges. Lounge in Singapore provided an excellent selection of food and service - offerings varied according to the time of day. Flight was expensive but it was a last minute booking due to a family emergency. We have booked to fly business class next year 2013 which was quite a bit cheaper booking early. Highly recommend the A380 and the Singapore configuration was very comfortable. Have travelled previously with Singapore Airlines in Economy and the service then was excellent. Would highly recommend both classes of travel with Singapore Airlines but if you can afford business class it is certainly a very enjoyable experience.","Product Review"

Miss your Star Alliance gold status for this year and the Next year....very nice... In September 2011, My mother made a booking for a flight from Singapore to Maldives with Singapore Airline. Before booking her ticket, Mr. xxx (assistant) call to ensure if she wouldâ€™ve book this ticket, it wouldâ€™ve been an eligible fare with Singapore Airlines to earn frequent flyers miles. The agent confirmed that this type of ticket wouldâ€™ve been eligible. The Passenger booked the ticket along with The accompanist. Before paying the ticket, an option offering the passenger to view the reservation by sending an e-mail is offered. On this confirmation, we could see the â€˜â€™Yâ€™â€™ booking class (eligible class for earning miles with Aeroplan and star alliance members). The Passenger then went ahead with the payment for final confirmation of the ticket. The accompanist and The Passenger did receive the ticket by e-mail. The ticket is showing a â€˜â€™Yâ€™â€™ class. The accompanist called Singapore Airlines on the 19th of September as well to confirm that the class showing on the ticket was an eligible fare for miles accumulation. The agent at Singapore Airlines said ''Yes''. The accompanist ensured on both ways during the checking process that Singapore Airline had the Aeroplan number of The Passenger for miles accumulation. The Agent in Singapore as well as the agent in Male, Maldives, confirms that: â€˜â€™yes she would get her milesâ€™â€™. The Passenger only book this flight with Singapore Airline because she would get her miles in her Aeroplan account. On October 7th 2011, The accompanist Called Aeroplan to confirm they would send a request to Singapore airlines to add the miles because they where not reflecting in The Passengerâ€™s account.  On October 17th 2011, The accompanist called both Aeroplan and Singapore Airline to make sure the request was handled properly and the points will get in her account. Both companies said they would take care of it. The accompanist also send an e-mail to Singapore Airlines. On October the 21st 2011, Mr. Guillaume The accompanist call Aeroplan. Aeroplan answer him that Singapore Airlines refuse to give the points and they did not understand as it was a â€˜â€™Yâ€™â€™ class. They said they would send a request again because The Passenger should get her miles credited in her account. The accompanist then wrote an e-mail to Singapore Airline again. Singapore responded by saying it was not booked on a â€˜â€™Yâ€™â€™ class. They said that it was a system glitch and it was showing Y class at the time of booking but in their hands, it was not a â€˜â€™Yâ€™â€™ class. He also wrote to Star Alliance about the issue but star alliance said that they are not related to the booking of airline nor miles programs. Singapore denies their responsibilities. Aeroplan said I should call Air Canada because they handle the Program, Air Canada stays unresponsive. After many communication between all parties, there Is no solutions. The Passenger will not achieve her Gold Status Early recognition for this year and neither for next year because she did not get the miles from Singapore Airlines in her Aeroplan Account. Very Sad :( To top the story, they have lost one of the luggage and and the food was very bad. Do not order special meal.","Product Review"
2012-08-15,"OK",6,"I flew economy to Singapore on one of the older Boeing 747s and its age was starting to show on the interior. The screen wasn't great and the controls were difficult to use. We flew back on a smaller Boeing which was newer and consequently the in-flight entertainment experience was more positive - better screen, better controls. Having done my research, I found the cheapest price on their own website www.singaporeair.com. As I was paying for the ticket however, the website started ""experiencing problems"" and crashed in the middle of the transaction - I paid for a ticket but wasn't issued with one. Long story short, I had to wait three days for the money to reverse back onto my card and had to use money I allocated for other expenses to get my ticket while I waited for the money to make it back onto my card. Every time I called up their ticketing office, I spoke to a different person and had to repeat my story each time which was very frustrating. I was put on hold several times for lengthy periods. Apart from that, the in-flight experience was relatively pleasant. The staff are attentive to your requests and there were no problems with the flight itself.","Product Review"

The return journey from Istanbul to Cairo was once again ""acceptable"" but then Singapore to Brisbane I wondered whether I could actually make it through the flight without screaming. The aircraft seemed to have been built around the time of the Ark - I had a window seat but the gap between the seat and window, you could not even put a cushion to sleep as it kept falling through. The seats barely reclined, the movies and channels were not even worth watching (who chooses them!!) the blankets looked like they had come straight from a St Vincent De Paul op shop and the cushions weren't even worth having.

2012-05-30,"The best in my opinion",10,"I've been using Singapore Airlines for years as I travel very frequently from Perth to Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and Hong Kong on business. Usually I book online on their website but on occasion I have had to call a consultant mainly for advice on multi stopover flights. I notice some complain about SIA being expensive. I've found Cathay Pacific is much more expensive and Qantas is slightly more. There may well be cheaper options but all things considered I think SIA is well worth the cost. Personally I'm happy to pay more for quality and reliability. I am a PPS club member and their club rooms are the best in my opinion. I do fly business class mostly but on short flights like from Singapore to KL I have used economy. I can honestly say I have never had an issue on any flight with Singapore Airlines regardless of ticket class. The service on the ground and in the air is outstanding, they are rarely late departing and when they are its for understandable reasons. Their aircraft are clean, seating is very comfortable, the crew are happy to assist always, food is very good and communication is excellent. The only criticism I have is minor and that is their website has a tendency to go into meltdown if you try to book too many stops on the same trip but its not that big a deal. Fly with SA, you wont regret it.","Product Review"

Being both a Elite Gold Krisflyer & PPS member, I can give a genuine first-hand experience of SIA & it's services. Considering the costs of it's business & first class tickets, the services and standards do match up well & above my expectations. Without a doubt, when I do have the choice of airline, i will always choose SIA if I'm allocated the budget / authorised to fly business / first class. However, on numerous times due to last minute flight plans, I've been allocated to travel Economy class. Unfortunately, I will not always choose SIA. Lack of inflight staffing, poor customer service, poor english, smaller seats vs other airlines, dirty toilets are all reasons I am so hesitant, especially on flights longer than 4 hours.

2012-05-15,"SIA is rated highly because they get it right.",10,"I have been a Krisflyer member for years and I've booked several dozen flights in SIA's website and not once have I had an issue with not being awarded flyer points. I don't see how any KrisFlyer member who claims to have booked a flight on SIA's website would have a problem because its so straight forward a process. You log onto the site with your membership number and password, search for the flights to the destinations you want, select the preferred flights, confirm and pay for your tickets, how hard can that be? You are provided with a detailed itinerary, which includes the date and time of each flight, your class of ticket, which terminal your flight/s leaves from and the miles you will earn on each flight. You also have the option to select your seat and meal. My point is if a passenger wants to be assured of gaining the flyer points for their trip it makes more sense to book the ticket with the airline directly. Why rely on a third party only to find out you didn't get what you think you're entitled to and then blame SIA for it. Singapore Airlines is my preferred carrier because they are extremely good at what they do and that's what counts for me. Service, reliability, consistency, quality in flight and in their lounges, with flight crews and ground staff that are second to none and that's how they got to be an excellent airline. I would rate an airline on what matters and not on a petty issue like frequent flyer points, an issue that could have been avoided with some common sense.","Product Review"

2012-02-18,"A Great Airline",10,"Majority of my international travels are either by Qantas or Singapore Airlines. But more frequently would be on Singapore Airlines. It is not just the superior service but also the aircraft they are flying are newer. Usually before I book with an airline, I would normally check which aircraft they will be flying to my destination and I would recommend anyone to avoid 747 as it is one of the older aircraft and seats tend to cramp and engine is noisier. When flying with Singapore airlines, I choose to fly either with A380 or 777-300. With Singapore A380, try to go for upper deck seat, as it has 2-4-2 configuration, perfect for couple. It also has extra side compartment for the 2 seater. What I like the most about flying with Singapore Airlines is that, if you book direct from their website and providing you are a Krisflyer member, you can book and choose your seat immediately, even, when your flight is 6 or 8 months away. Unlike Qantas, where you can only select your seat 48 (or 24) hours prior to departure (and must also pay $20 for seat selection?), you have none of that with Singapore Airlines. Another feature that I like (and other airlines starting to have this) is that you can do internet check-in 48 hours prior to departure.","Product Review"

Cabin Crew and Accomodation is probably second to none, although CX was also pretty good in the 90's and 00's as well. But with the A380 SQ now has the edge. The SQ Terminal is perfect for SQ travellers. (kind silly if you dont travel with them, life is made so easy).. Shopping, day trips to SIN, cinema in house as well as reasonable priced food on the ""non-airside"".. means you have to enter SIN then reenter. (No big deal and takes only 5 mins at worst)... I always tell immigration, ""I am stepping out to have a meal at Burger King it cheaper outside than inside"" - Always gets a smile. Plus I am back within 90 minutes.... Back to SQ - Economy Class consistently good. Though I have been annoyed with Business Class at times, simply because I occassionally get bumped at the last minute, due to higher Kris Flyers boarding than me. It an Asian thing, but you are judged on loyalty and milage... Though I fly each fortnight with SQ... Its low miles on the PER-SIN-CGK route so hence I dont build up the points like many regulars. Nevertheless, Business Class and First Upgrades esp A380 are excellent for long haul 10 hr plus travel stints. Thanks again SQ","Product Review"

2011-11-16,"Excellent",10,"I travelled internationally pretty regularly, I've flied via Air China, Qantas, JAL, China Southern airline and Singapore airline. I found Singapore airline is the best among all these airlines I've flied with. I've booked both Business class and Economic class. I've been very satisfied with both service. When my eld parents come to visit me from overseas, I had no hesitate booked them tickets and travelled via Singapore airline. They provided very helpful service when my father missed his domestic flight to Beijing for his international flight to Sydney via Singapore due to the Chinese domestic flight was cancelled. When my father finally arrived Beijing, it's only 30mins before his international flight to Singapore would departure. The staff of Singapore airline in Beijing was so nice, comfort my father and arrange him to rest at the lounge and change his flight to the very next flight to Sydney via Singapore. I can't appreciate enough for what they have done for my father. and will definitely continue choosing the Singapore airline for my family's international travel.","Product Review"
2011-07-29,"Terrible",2,"I was suprised to see the lack of service on the singapore airlines, Sydney to Singapore route (economy class). Generally flying Qantas this route, i decided to go with SA after seeing some great online reviews; to be heavily let down. Firstly i was .5 of a kg over for checked baggage, and the checkin clerk would not accept the baggage - with Qantas/BA ive been over 6kg over and they never say anything. Secondly the service in the sky was terrible. The food truely tasted like plastic (i am not a fussy eater), and when called for an FA, it took 4 pushes of the button and 20 minutes for them to respond, only to get my request wrong 2 times. The cabin crew after serving meals disapeared to the back of the plane where they seemed to be having a large conversation between themselves (i was sitting near the back). The older lady who was sitting next to me also called for an FA for a cup of tea, though again no-one came. This time after 5 minutes i walked to the back of the plane and asked them myself to make this poor lady a cup of tea. The FA's were clearly not happy and would have prefered to continue there conversation. Thirdly, my baggage got lost after arriving at Singapore. It took 2 days for it to arrive. The funny thing about it was that it was a direct flight - never knew this could happen. Overall SA was a big let down. After seeing good reviews i thought that they would be a really good airline. I could not notice any difference between seat comfort and legroom compared to other airlines flying this route, and due to the events which occured, i would consider this to be discraceful and an embarrasement to SA. For a while anyways i will fly Qantas, where i have never experienced a bad flight. Will not even consider flying SA until they get there game together. Was a really big let down :-(","Product Review"

The meals presented were great and they were extremely helpful to the point of calling me by phone to check on something with me. I would fly with them again in an instant and on the ay home the flight was not fully booked so after the doors had closed they allowed a lot of passengers to choose better spots to sit. Some chose front seats for leg room and some chose others so they could strech across the seat better. Even after changing seats they still kept track of where we were for our special meals and didn't miss a beat.","Product Review"

The in-flight entertainment is awesome; I can choose from a range of games to play such as quizzes and ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"", listen to music singles or albums or I could watch critically-acclaimed movies released recently.

2010-03-28,"Excellent",10,"My parents have lived overseas for a number of years now, and during that time I have travelled on multiple airlines in both economy and business class. Comparatively I think Qantas' business class is just as good if not better than Singapore Airlines. But in economy, SA has better food and better service. Also SA's frequent flyer program is much, much more generous that Qantas'. As a comparison an any seat any time flight on Singapore Airlines from Adelaide to Singapore is about 20 000-30 000 points less expensive than Qantas' equivilant. But in a tradeoff Qantas usually has cheaper tickets on the same route. Overall, Sinapore Airlines is one of my favourite airlines in ecoonomy.","Product Review"

That statistics speak for itself since I had always enjoyed my flight with this airline. The seats are comfortable even for economy class. The food choices are great. The service is impeccable. The on flight entertainment is fabulous. Most of the time, I enjoy my time on the air more than those on the ground. Not to mention the internationally renowned Singapore Airport. The shopping and facility there is fantastic. The smooth transit is another thing that I like about this airline. One thing I need to mention though, is the last time I flew with them, there was an issue with the luggage compartment. although it wasn't in anyone's expectation to have this inconvenience, I found the way they dealt with this particular case rather poor. And since I pay a premium for flying with them, I'd think twice now before making the decision to fly again.","Product Review"

I fly with them every year for at least 5-6 hours. The movie section helps to kill the time and I even didnt finish the second movie that I was watching. Movies are very new and some even havent shown in cinema perth. If you dont like movies, you can try games and even play chess with other players inside the flight. I never like the food provided on board in any airline but I would say the food they give is good. The taste is simple and nice which mostly suit everyone.

I felt that they have done a pretty good job in maintaining a high standard of services and the price is pretty reasonable.

2008-06-30,"Excellent",10,"Fantastic airline with friendly helpful staff. We were travelling with an 11mth old and the service provided to us and her was fantastic. Firstly people travelling with a child get to board the aircraft first. We got given an emergency pack of nappies, wipes, bib, baby food and a toy. Whenever we required a bottle or food to be heated it would be done straight away. We would be given/offered our meals seperatly (early) so one could look after the baby. At one stage an hostess found a free toilet with a change table for me. An additional nice touch is that they remember and refer to your baby by their name. We were also seated at the bulkhead which gave us the benifit of using the crib and extra leg/storage room. Not in relation to us but there was a mother travelling opposite us on her own and I thought it was fantastic when the flight attendant came and looked after the child so the mother could eat/go to the toilet.","Product Review"

2007-06-11,"Excellent",10,"Singapore Airlines has a good name, well-earned. Their food is much better than most airlines supply to their economy passengers, far more than the generic foil box containing something unidentifiable (and preferably left unidentified), with a bread roll. The in-flight service is excellent, and the different uniforms make a nice change. The seats are much more comfortable than one would usually expect to find on in economy-class. Also, the in-flight entertainment is somewhat better. Rather than simply having a number of movies constantly looping, each person can choose to start, pause, fast-forward and rewind the films they watch when they want to. A small extra, but significant when you're on a long flight.","Product Review"

You get wonderful, fresh food with all of your meals. You never go hungry or thirsty, and the hostess is not stingy on the drinks. The seating is arranged better than most planes so that each seat is larger, and therefore more comfortable for longer flights. There are many forms of entertainment from computer games where you play against the computer, to games where you play against other people on the plane.

Not only did she check us and our (FREE!) luggage in, she went the extra mile of giving us a map and explaining which terminal our connection in Singapore would most likely be at.The Boeing 777-300 that we flew on the most important 13+ hour leg of our first stop in Hong Kong is probably the best flight experience I've ever had, despite its length. The 11"" touchscreen monitor with games, TV shows, and movies on demand, totally ruined my plans of catching up with Yelp reviews during the flight. With some of the latest DVD releases available, I caught up with 4 movies that I had yet to see instead.I love that even even though you are in economy class, they treat you as if you were flying first class. Decent (even Vegan) meals, hot towels, free booze (yes FREE!) and more! I can't imagine the level of service the next few classes up. They were almost too attentive. They kept waking us up every few hours with food or drinks. There is a do not disturb option on your in seat monitor if you wish to use it.It doesn't hurt that the flight attendants all look like beauty pageant contestants. That's probably because they basically are. Heck even the dudes are pretty. Just remember blue dress will be very pretty and could be a total n00b. Green dress, most likely pretty but has much more experience. Red dress, most likely not pretty but has the most experience. The same with the guys and their ties. Next time I fly any direction that Singapore serves I hope I am able to utilize their amazing service again.","Yelp"
2016-08-02,NA,2,"I dont know what to say. It seems I got trapped by airlines who do business judging people's mindset. I was tracking to book an international ticket to VTZ, India for more than 2 months. Suddenly they put 'only few tickets left' and then I acted fast and bought my ticket for 1500$ (where as other carriers are offering for atleast 200$ less). Suddenly after 2 days, I can see a price drop of 200$ for the same ticket I bought. I was shocked, reached the airlines and they said cancellation and refund costs me 200$ even I tried cancelling before 48hrs of booking. I think not to buy tickets in SG anymore. Even having tickets for other nearest destinations in other carriers for 900-1000$, my inclination towards SG airlines has burned my pocket.","Yelp"
2016-07-07,NA,2,"Singapore Airlines website stated that they allow pet travel for dogs 3 months or older. I have a 4 month old puppy. I booked a flight with Singapore Airlines and then later found out that they can't transport dogs less than 6 months old. Singapore Airlines refused to accomodate my request even after I pointed out that their website clearly states that dogs 3 months or older can travel with them. I spoke to two Singapore Airline representatives and told them that I can even get a recommendation letter from my vet that my dogs are healthy for travel. However, both representatives stated that they changed their policy on June 1, 2016. I ended up cancelling my flight and took a loss because Singapore Airlines wouldn't accomdate my request given that their website provides false/misleading information. I went with Asiana Airlines who accomodated my request.Please update Singapore Airlines website to reflect proper information. I took a loss because of this company's negligence.

The entire staff made the long ass flight as comfortable as possible. One suggestion: soundproof room for crying asshole kids.The food options were great; dumplings, eggs, roasted potatoes, noodles, Magnum bar ice cream, cheesecake, salads, etc. (American, Chinese, and Indian). Plenty of in between things to snack on if you wish (chips, cookies, candies, bars, etc.). Alcoholic drinks are free - I do not drink so I did not care about this option. Warm towels after you are seated? Wow. I loved it. A pillow and blanket is on every seat. You get access to new movies (some not out on DVD yet), shows, and games. I watched a lot of Disney movies (Toy Story 1, Toy Story 2, Toy Story 3, Ratatouille, Tangled, Good Dinosaur) amongst others. BTW, Everest is a great documentary. Will fly w/ them in a few months.

For once, each seat has their own tv monitor, although the last I flew overseas, I was on a UA Dreamliner and there was tv monitor at each seat.Based on my past experiences with UA, I was prepared for a long and boring journey and didn't know what to expect from SA. I brought magazines, iPad, neck pillow, blanket, water bottle, all kinds of snacks, noise cancelling headphones and anything you can think of to be comfortable on a tiny seat but I was totally impressed by what SA has to offered.

2015-07-14,NA,8,"Didn't quite live up to expectations given their reputation.I've been wanting to fly on Singapore Airlines in Business Class for years. I had heard such great things about their service. So when I finally got the chance, I guess my expectations were set pretty high.The business seats on the new 777's are really nice. No inside seats and having to climb over people like you do in United Business. The entertainment system is modern with a large monitor and separate touch screen color remote that uses swipe gestures. The back of the seat flips over to create the bed, but there is no separate mattress like Air New Zealand and while it is much better than the United reclining seat, the bed is not as comfortable as Air New Zealand. I also just love the Air New Zealand Business seating layout, where you get a little guest chair in case you have a visitor.The food quality was good, but for my palate, too large and a little boring. The food is not really restaurant class. Virgin America, even though it is only a domestic carrier does much more interesting restaurant class food. One of the best Mushroom and truffle oil omeletes I've ever had was on a Virgin America short flight from San Diego to San Francisco. The service was efficient, but a little aloof. Not at all what I had expected given the hype. For example converting the seat to a bed is not an obvious process, but the Singapore flight attendants leave you to figure this out your self. Air New Zealand does a much better job of making a big deal of making up your bed with a fresh matress and comforter for you.In summary I loved the Singapore airlines seats and entertainment system, but was disappointed in the food and service. For the SFO-HKG route I thought Cathay Pacific was a little better. For overall international service I am now a total Air New Zealand fan.","Yelp"

2016-08-13,NA,2,"My first phone call to the customer service was really a nightmare. I had a challenging time to understand the customer service representative. For courtesy reason, I didn't tell her that I barely could understand her English but kindly asked her to slow down. She simply ignored me and rudely told me that all the customer service representatives from Singapore Airlines speak English only. I didn't feel like correcting her attitude over the phone. So, I asked her about the round trip ticket price from Bangkok to Singapore in early November. She quoted $980 for the flight. I just purchase my tickets from San Jose to Singapore (November as well) with ANA and the round trip ticket is only $670. So, I asked the customer representative to check the price again. She was very impatience and raised her voice. On the same day, I checked Singapore Airlines official web site and found the USD 233 ticket price. Where is the business ethic? Totally rip off from Singapore Airlines.Two days later, I make the reservation on the official website for USD 233. The receipt and confirmation do not specify any cancellation policy or change of traveling dates. Regardless my previous unfavorable experience with the customer service representative, I called the customer service hotline again. I was told there is no way I can change the date of my trip and I will never get a single dime back if I cancelled my trip. In other words, the customer service representative simply told me that Singapore Airlines will not give the customers any options. Again, what kind of customer service you have? Excuse me. I am really disappointed with Singapore Airlines. Couldn't Singapore Airlines improve a bit and assist your customers?","Yelp"
2016-05-16,NA,10,"I recently flew from Tokyo to Los Angeles on Singapore Airlines in economy.I will never fly on another airline, if a flight is available on Singapore Airlines.Best treatment I have received on an airline in 50 years of flying.","Yelp"
2015-07-03,NA,10,"Definitely the BEST airline I've flown with. I really, really hate flying. Nothing's worse than being confined to a small space and more or less forced to sit for hours on end. But my latest experience with Singapore Airlines was so incredibly pleasant, I didn't mind the 25 hour trek each way. And I was flying economy. I can't imagine what it's like flying business or first class. I really can't think of anything negative to say about them. And I'd definitely be willing to pay a little extra to fly with Singapore over other airlines in the future.THE PERKS:   + YUMMY FOOD. I love food and eating, and airplane food pretty much always disappoints me, but theirs is actually good. Definitely opt for the Asian meals rather than the American ones. It's a little sad but some of the meals I had on these flights were better than food I've had in restaurants.. They even serve legit desserts like ice cream and It's It ice cream sandwiches.   + Complimentary alcohol. Yes, even for economy class. Wine, beer, hard liquor.. just don't get wasted.   + Basically an endless supply of food. Their in-flight menu has a page of light snacks for in between the scheduled meals, like sandwiches, fruit, cookies/biscuits and chocolate.    + In flight entertainment. Individual TVs with SO MANY OPTIONS. Movies, TV shows, music.. Even recent releases. I was never bored.   + Pouches with socks and toothbrush/paste for long flights. So simple and easy to provide yet I'll bet a ton of people don't remember or bother to pack a toothbrush for overseas flights. And socks are easily overlooked! You don't realize you need them until your feet are freezing on the plane.   + Hot towels to freshen up before a flight. I especially appreciated these if I had traveled through intense Asian heat and humidity.   + USB outlets. We're so dependent on technology nowadays that you'd think this should be as basic as water, but I'm not sure that all airlines have these on their planes. Either way, seeing these definitely made me happy. Not that I really needed my phone for entertainment with their endless movie offering.But what makes Singapore Airlines really amazing is their OUTSTANDING SERVICE. Like not just friendly, attentive, helpful staff. But they REALLY go over the top.   + Going off on the endless supply of food.. You can ask them for a snack any time during your flight, and if you're too embarrassed to ask for more food, don't worry, they're practically itching to give away food. I bumped into them in the steward(ess)/kitchen area on the way back from the bathroom, they'd just ask me if I wanted a snack. And when I simply asked them for a cup of water, they offered me food as well.   + Toys for kids. Sorry to all the parents out there, but crying babies/children on planes are the worst. There's absolutely no way to escape so you're just trapped with the screeching and wailing. But thank goodness for Singapore Airline's foresight into this problem. I've seen the stewards and stewardesses bring kids toys and crayons and things to keep them entertained and to try them to stop crying for the sake of other passengers. Doesn't always work, but it's the thought and effort that counts.   + The steward/stewardesses would actually turn on my reading light for me when the cabin was dimmed and I was reading/writing in dim light because I didn't want to disturb my neighbors.   + Continuing on my idiocy, I left my glasses on the departure leg of a roundtrip flight. I emailed Singapore Airlines, feeling very frustrated with myself, and they replied promptly, telling me I could pick up my glasses at the check-in counter any time during working hours. I, unfortunately, was already leaving for a different city on my trip, but they were happy to hold my glasses until I was back for my returning flight. When I went in to check in for that flight, I didn't even have to mention or ask for my glasses. One of the staff came up to me as I was being checked in and brought me my glasses without any effort on my part!Seriously, if you're flying to/from/within Asia and have the option of flying with Singapore Airlines, DO IT.","Yelp"

I called the SA office and informed them of the inconvenience, especially because one of the passenger is a special needs passenger. Their offer of a full refund was like a slap in the face, considering that I made many other tour bookings based on this trip.

The Singapore Airline staffer at the counter immediately told them their European sized carry-on was too big and they'd have to buy another seat to strap in their suitcase. He was rude, yelling at the customers and making a huge scene!! He then proceeded to tell them the flight was full and that they'd have to wait until the following day to fly!! This was a red eye flight! (SQ Flight 608 from SIN to ICN on May 30, 2015.I think the situation could have been better handled. The Singapore Airline staffer could have been more calm. He should have offered to check in the bags. The whole situation could have been SO less dramatic! Instead, all passengers of Gate B9 heard and saw the incidence! This was very unprofessional and made us very uncomfortable!If I was in this situation, I would not have passively let the staffer yell at me or embarrass me like this. It would have been a big, ugly shouting match and I would definitely file a complaint against Singapore Airlines.

Thankfully the stewardess came to my aid to remove the stains covering the sleeve of my brand new white jacket. She then proceeded to sit in the aisle while we worked on it getting the stains out with her magic (and saving my jacket)! So amazing - I couldn't thank her enough. Only reason why I'm not giving 5 stars is because it is a bit slower service than I have experienced on other flights (air france and virgin) and 2 of the 4 flights they ran out of one choice of dish which was kind of a bummer so I strongly suggest bringing snacks or a meal from the airport if you're a picky eater like me 0:-)  But for the most part their food was really good.Please note I have never had to call them or use any services with changing flight dates or contact information which I've read is awful through other yelp reviews.

Also, the restrooms are spacious, unlike Cathay Pacific, where I literally have to squat a little just to pee (tmi, I know).2) Their food is actually good - Do take this with a grain of salt as I am one of the few weirdos that actually like airplane food.3) Friendly flight attendants - I've sat next to a difficult traveler once and the flight attendant that was assisting this difficult person never flinched nor showed frustration not once! They always walk around the plane with a smile on their faces, which is nice when you're stuck immobile for 14 hours at a time (depending on where you fly to). 4) Every seat has their own television sets and they've actually got a decent variety of movies to choose from.

On my flight from Singapore to Tokyo they were just slanging drinks the whole time. So much so that i had to cut myself off because i didnt want to get trashed on a 7 hour flight. best piece of advice is to get a window seat on the long hauls flights. Its soo much easier to sleep for hours on end that way. I had a 14 hour, 3 hour, 7 hour, and 10 hour flights with them. Then a 1 hour flight on Virgin. The one star is for their policies which are unbelievably atrocious. I had a flight booked for a Monday but due to a ""Super Typhoon"" that is set to hit Japan I wanted to fly back home before. Makes sense right? Wait to be stuck in Japan and miss work...or get home safely before the storm hits. 4 hour and 3 days of time they kept telling me that they could not move my flight from Tokyo to LAX because i had a flight from LAX to SFO on Virgin....well I was totally fine with the Virgin flight. That is not the one that I wanted changed. I wanted to get out of Tokyo because of the storm. After hours and hours and hours they told me that they could not change it again due the flight on Virgin. So finally just told them move the Tokyo flight and i will deal with the virgin flight.Soo pissed off!!!! I eventually got the flight moved from Monday to Sunday which cost me $175 extra. But then at that point they said that they could not take my payment and that i would have to wait for ""some time"" for them to call me back. well i am on vacation in a different country so did not have the luxury of waiting for ""some time"".So at this point, i had to call my insurance company to get them to change my flight and take my payment. Uhhh just writting this makes me hate this experience. So now i need to file a claim with my insurance because they could not do something so simple as change a damn flight. Its not that hard. And if you cannot change a flight because of a different company...then learn how to do it. Its so easy.Oh they did send me a letter later saying ""sorry"" but no type of compensation.

I will never use them again, and I will never again send a family member on one of their flights.Not worth my money.","Yelp"

2015-09-14,NA,4,"I am rating this based on the customer service (thru phone).I tried to call the customer service thru both the toll free number and the 312-843-5333 number, both of them lead to the waiting time more than an hour and once someone pick up my phone, he told me that I called the wrong department because I should call the Kris Flyer number instead. However, both number has the automatic system and let me choose the Kris Flyer department and reward flight inquiry. So the representative put me to the ""kris flyer dept"" again and I had to wait for it for so long for nothing. I did try to make this call over the weekend already, I had 2-3 times over 1hr wait experience without anyone pick up the phone. Singapore Airline claims the customer service is 24h every day, I wonder how they can make this claim when I had tried multiple times attempts to contact anyone over the phone. All I want to do is to cancel a reward flight, and it is not allowed to do it online. If you let people change flight online, then why not cancel flight? It will save people so much time. I fly Singapore airline for business all the time, I can't believe the customer service is that poor. This is a huge disappointment and I can't imagine if I have something urgent and require to speak to a representative.","Yelp"

2012-04-24,NA,8,"I recently took a 33 hour trip over to Vietnam, with layovers in both Seoul and Singapore. I was dreading the experience, but as soon as I stepped on board, I had a feeling I'd cope just fine.The onboard entertainment was oustanding. Due to a snafu w/ my departure flight (I didn't have one!), I wasn't able to pick up any books or magazines prior to boarding. With only my IPOD to keep me sane, I was thrilled to find countless movies (both old and new), television shows, music, and books on tape. In addition to all that, I also found the magazine racks on the plane (near the flight attendant stations) and grabbed the latest Time, Business Week and Asian fashion mags. Seriously, my trip FLEW by with no problem.The reason I am docking a star is because they are very strict with visas. I almost missed my flight because they held me at the counter for over an hour. They insisted I book a departure flight out of Vietnam and I was unsuccessful as their wifi kept going down. I was only able to board once I signed off on a waiver. It caused a lot of unnecessary stress (especially since the flight crew had to send two employees down to escort me to the plane.) And of course, once I arrived, I had no problem at all getting into Vietnam without a departure flight. So book at your own risk. Another bit of a downer was the lack of variety on their vegetarian meals. I had literally the same meal three times. I can't even think of eating tofu curry again without gagging. Other than that, the experience was about as comfortable as a 33 hour trip could be. I would definitely book with them again.","Yelp"
2013-07-10,NA,2,"I have loved Singapore Airlines in the past. Our last trip to Southeast Asia was not so good. All Singapore Air flight attendants used to be awesome. They used to treat you so good. Most of the flight attendants on this trip were nice. I'd say only one flight attendant in each section was great. At least one on each flight (out of six legs) was completely rude. Unacceptable for such an expensive flight. The ""new clean"" blankets that were on our seat were stained with red wine and the pillows had dirt and hair all over them. The internet did not work for our entire trip (going over to Cambodia or coming back). I understand this is a luxury to have in flight, but don't advertise it if it isn't going to work.My husbands entertainment screen did not work on the flight back from Japan. Talk about a miserable ten hour flight. It was a full flight so the flight attendant could not move him. They didn't even seem to really care that it wasn't working. Just said sorry and offered to bring him some magazines. A gate agent in Singapore was less than helpful when we asked for assistance. Our group of five wanted to sit near each other. When we asked him to check and see if there was anything he could do, he said it was an oversold flight and there wasn't anything he could do. He didn't even try!I am so disappointed with Singapore Air.","Yelp"

So we carefully planned on items, weight and size for all our carry-on luggage. Moment we stepped onto the flight the chief air hostess yelled out! singled one of our carry-on and said its too big and would not fit in and would have to be checked-in. I insisted that she measure it, she refused. ( She was like the buck stops with me bro!). She was like ""oh man! your carry-on is a stand out! how could anyone not agree! ""Ok! She gave me a bag to gather essentials from the carry-on. 2 of her colleagues where watching us with a big wicked smile. Many other passengers were watching the show with sympathy. I had no choice!! Now I was having hard time to decide on stuff that we would not need. You know we had packed it with utmost care. Sensing that it would take us a very long time, all 3 excused themselves and gave us 3 minutes to wrap things up! It took me 30 sec to come up with a wise plan of my own. I knew my carry-on was the right size and half the folks had similar carry on. All black! You get it! I whispered my plans into my spouse ears. She was like ""you cannot possibly pull this off!"". I was like, ""its worth a try""!I quickly zipped up whatever was still in the carry-on and rolled it quietly down the aisle and tucked it inside the overhead cabin. Came back and joined my wife with the big wicked smile of my own. My plan had already worked!My wife was still nervous, but the look on my face must have irritated the chief. I was standing with that little bag and no Carry-on! I explained to her that it easily fit in! She got furious and raised her voice and ordered me to go get my carry-on back.I said, ""Chief.. My carry-on was according to you a standout! too big to fit in! So you should not have trouble finding it and checking it in.. go ahead"". She bashed down the aisle opened the nearest overhead and pulled one out! I nodded! She pulled it out with a big smile! The passenger next to it screamed back at her! She put it back with a sorry! My smile and many sympathizing passengers smile all widened with every carr-yon she pulled out!Her only choice was to to ground the plane to find my baggage! Pilot walked up to me with a big smile of his own! I smiled back and said ""Sir, every carry-on that she pulled out should also be obviously big and needed to be checked-in sir!"" He know! He walked us 4 to our seats with the same big smile and my wife relieved. Made many friends that segment! Chief did not show up the entire flight.Had few more experiences like this.. will post my best one last, when I get sometime.My friends wanted me sue the airlines for racism.

After several frustrating phone calls where PetMovers didn't answer their phones, I emailed them.

2013-07-07,NA,10,"I could see the immediately see the difference between my preferred carrier and Singapore Airlines when I walked up to the ticket counter. Normally, I am greeted by a machine and have to wait for the one or two agents to visit me because they are covering multiple check-in stations at the same time. Not so at Singapore. In fact, I actually had three people there to help me, all with smiles and warm greetings. Check-in was fast and easy. Within moments, I was given my boarding pass and a slip of paper to admit me to the Star Alliance Lounge before takeoff.  Sweet.Boarding the plan is also different. The gate agent simply strolled up to the podium and said we could all now board the plane. There was not this cattle call of people herding into special lanes or jockeying for position to be the first on the plane. Just people casually walking onto a plane and easily placing their bags and luggage into the abundant overhead storage bins.So, first impression: 1. The cabin seating. Seeing row after row of large business class seating with the lay flat beds) was terrific. Normally, I am sitting in the standard cramped and tiny tourist cabin seats and I could not stomach the thought of trying to fall asleep in one of those on a flight for 16 hours. (No, those silly neck roll things to not work for me and I cannot sleep upright) The seats are large and roomy. Even the largest American bottom could easily fit in these seats! The seats recline and there is a space to prop up your feed for added comfort. The seats also fold down into a lay-flat configuration for sleeping. Heavy blankets are provided to keep you warm, although the cabin temperature is quite warm without having to use the blanket. I wouldn't say the bed rivals a memory foam mattress in comfort, but it isn't bad and certainly gets the job done. If you are a bit taller (6' or taller), you'll have to do a bit of the fetal position sleeping. The entertainment system is filled with movies and TV shows to keep you occupied when not sleeping. There is power to keep your laptop running and recharge your cell phone. Don't worry about bringing along your noise cancelling headset because one is provided. Yours wouldn't work anyway as the plug is an odd three-pronged thing that I know does not come standard with headsets like Bose. I've been in United's Business Class seats and these do seem roomier. Grab a seat by the window as the privacy panels on the side of the seat and the staggered spacing ensures that you can't see your neighbor and they can't see you.  2. The cabin crew.  OK, so I will admit the crew is attractive. The women all wear the same patterned dress/uniform and look terrific. I suppose the men too are attractive, but I honestly didn't notice! Across both genders, however, their smiles and desire to assist the passengers seem genuine. After the dinner service (the Sea Bass was cooked perfectly) and a few glasses of really good scotch, I decided to close my eyes and rest. I put on the provided eye mask to block out the light. After just a few minutes, I felt a light tap on my shoulder. The flight attendant assigned to my area politely asked if I knew how to fold down my bed into the lay-flat position and she offered to help. In fact, I didn't know and was grateful she set me straight from the beginning. After that, my nap turned into several hours of deep sleep. My attendant even came and gave me a bottle of water, placing it in my ""cup holder"". When I went to reach for it later, I discovered she already opened the bottle, cracking the seal and leaving the cap lightly screwed on the bottle. I don't have arthritis so I could have done that myself, but that attention to detail is impressive.3. The bathrooms. They certainly can be described as clean and pleasant. Each bathroom comes complete with shaving kits, mouthwash, nice smelling soaps and lotions. They have cologne for both men and women. Even the towels, which are cotton, are infused with a pleasant scent. The sinks are larger than what I am used to, making it easier to get my entire hand under the faucet to freshen up.  And there seem to be an adequate number of them as there isn't the usual long line of passengers at the end of the aircraft waiting for a bathroom to open up. I will admit, the disposable razor they provided cut my face up a bit. The downside:1. The Internet - $25 for 30MB of usage. I used up my allotment very quickly after just a few quick emails and some standard web surfing. If you want to use the Internet, I suggest you forgo web surfing or updating your facebook status until you land. Craft all of your emails beforehand and then connect so that you won't burn through your MB's as quickly as I did. 2. 17+ hours of flight time. This isn't Singapore Airlines fault... it is just a looonnnggg time to be in the air!","Yelp"

I generally don't like flying (not to mention fear of heights!) but they make it bearable. Each time, I boarded one of their Boeing 777-300ER's. On the plane, each seat had its own screen with a remote, which operates a comprehensive entertainment system. I was thoroughly impressed, browsing through all the choices of movies, dramas, and music that they had to offer. They have virtually any genre of music or motion picture that you can think of. Throughout the entire plane ride, I didn't even find the need to take out my iTouch or DS! The in-flight service was equally wonderful, as the famous Singapore Girls did not disappoint.The attendants were all very hospitable and friendly - not to mention attentive! Drinks and snacks were being brought by around the clock, they even offered some wine and cocktails (an offer I took advantage of!) Passengers were fed an entire three meals within each flight, with the meals being so sumptuous that, by the 2nd mealtime, I was unable to finish all of my food.I'm going to be flying with them again in the coming spring, and I rather look forward to it!","Yelp"

2013-08-22,NA,2,"We have been loyal Singapore Airlines customers for a long time, flying trans-pacific round-trips every year. However, this year the experience was really horrible when we missed a connecting flight.We missed our connection in Singapore on 08 August 2013 through an oversight on our part - we were tired from an overnight flight and mistakenly thought our connecting flight was SQ016 at 9:25 AM instead of SQ600 at 8 AM. By the time we realized the mistake and scrambled to the departure gate for SQ600, the gate had closed - we were late by 2 minutes. We were directed to 'Singapore Airlines Transfer Desk' to rebook on SQ016. Singapore Airlines Customer Service Representative was more interested in charging us a 'No Show Penalty' than trying to assist us get on another flight. We paid $100 for each ticket as 'Penalty'. This is the first time in 30 years of flying that I have ever been asked to pay a penalty for 'No Show'. After paying the fee and waiting for an hour to be put on 'Stand-by', we were finally told there were no seats available on SQ16. We were directed to go out to the 'Departure' area and seek assistance from 'Singapore Airlines Reservations Desk'. We went through immigration and on to Singapore Airlines Reservations desk. Singapore Airlines Customer Service patiently listened to us but in the end was not helpful. They informed us that all flights from Singapore to SFO or LAX were completely full for the next 5 days. There was nothing they could do to help us. They offered to put us on 'Stand-by' for SQ002 at 5:50 PM. We were asked to retrieve our checked luggage from Terminal 2 (where we had disembarked) and re-check them in on the SQ002 if we were able to make stand-by. We went to Terminal 2 'Lost and Found' to retrieve our two bags, and were told the luggage was actually in Terminal 3. We trudged back to Terminal 3 'Lost and Found' and finally retrieved the luggage. We stood in line for SQ002 and at 5:10 were told the flight was full. There was nothing 'Singapore Airlines Check-in Staff' could do to help us! We could try go stand-by for the next flight next day and so on for the next 5 days.This was an unacceptable offer. I have a job to go to and the expense of staying in Singapore for 5 days would far exceed the cost of buying new tickets. So we decided to do the only practical thing and buy one-way tickets on another Airline. We flew out to San Francisco on Korean/United Air later that same night. We sent a formal complaint to Singapore Airlines and they curtly told us to talk to our travel agent!

2012-05-09,NA,10,"I don't consider myself an expert traveler by any means. There are plenty of people who travel on a weekly basis, and by comparison, I might still be considered a novice in the field of air transportation. However, for someone who goes on trips purely for pleasure 90% of the time, I would say that I do fly quite a bit more frequently than most of my peers. I average about 3 international and 20 domestic trips per year for the past couple years, so I'm definitely not new to the enclosed environment that we all fondly cough know as airplanes.Unfortunately, I haven't won the lottery. I hope that someday I will make enough to be able to fly Business or First on my own accomplishments, but for now, I have to settle for Economy like most of the traveling community to be able to appease my huge appetite for wanderlust. For those who have been on those 12+ hour trips abroad, you know it's not the most ideal situation. Seats are usually a little more cramped than you would like, the food is almost always less than par, and amenities? Forget it. Consider yourself lucky if you're able to somehow procure a toothbrush. I flew with Singapore Air for the first time about a week ago simply because the flight time was the most convenient, and I must say that I have never been more pleasantly surprised by an airline in my life. There were obvious pluses that one simply could not ignore. First, there was much more legroom than any other Economy cabin I've ever sat in. Second, the personal screens were actually rather large, extremely clear, and had the largest selection of movies, shows, and music I've ever had the pleasure of being able to choose from. On top of all that, the bathrooms were COLOSSAL! And clean!!! With simply all of the aforementioned qualities, I would easily have been satisfied. However, it was the smaller attention to detail that really set Singapore Air apart in my mind. To start, each of the seats had footrests that you could pull down. Trust me. It helps. A lot. But to be fair, I've been on other flights with footrests, so that might not be an enormously unique aspect. The bathrooms also had faucets that you didn't have the hold down to dispense water. Instead, they were the kind that you push down once to get a couple seconds of flow. Convenient. The trashcans inside also had a pedal you push down with your foot to open, so you don't have to touch the disgusting flap and soil your hands. Amazing for a germaphobe such as myself. At the beginning of the flight, they also passed out small Givenchy pouches that contained a toothbrush, toothpaste, and a pair of comfortable, disposable socks that you could wear if you so chose to kick off your shoes. Don't mind if I do! Lastly, the food was not half bad gasp, and the cabin service was impeccable. They even gave us ice cream sandwiches for dessert! Yayyyy! I looooove ice cream! I know some of these might not seem like a big deal, but all of them together really make a big difference when you're stuck inside a small space for half of an entire day (or more).All in all, I would recommend flying with SA if it were ever an option, even if it was to cost a little more than the cheapest alternative. And to whoever is running the show, I'd like to give a big round of applause. It is very apparent that they care about their customer, and because of that, they've gained a new loyal patron in me.","Yelp"
2013-01-08,NA,2,"A huge pain in the butt. I bought a ticket for my GF. I had to go down to SFO to turn in ""Letter of Indemnity"". Some how they lost it. So now I have to go back to the airport and do the process all over again.","Yelp"
2012-07-22,NA,6,"It's clear that Singapore Airlines puts all their effort into in-flight experience and everything else, like web site and reservation system, is pretty poor. If you can buy a ticket and don't need to change it, you'll probably have the best in-flight experience possible on an airplane although that isn't saying much. Singapore Airlines is all hype; it's just another airline.When I tried to buy the tickets off the web site, it took several tries, particularly with a giant page of information with fields that would randomly reset and error messages that were confusing. Finally, I did figure out the ""magic combination"" of values that would cause the web site to work.Singapore Airlines totally and completely failed me and endangered my family. When my family had a serious medical emergency and needed to return home early, it was a nightmare. The call center couldn't help and my ""confirmed"" reservations were randomly canceled. Each day, I'd wake up to check the web site to see what was screwed up overnight. I spent hours on the phone although I must admit that I usually got through quickly. They also gave me a lot of erroneous and incorrect information, probably because they didn't know, not because they lied. Mostly, they just sent e-mails to the seat controller/head office/waitlist dept which was ineffective (to say the least).BTW, (65) 6223-8888 and (800) 742-3333 go to the same call center (at least when I wrote this). The guy from (65) 6223-8888 confirmed that he works in the same building as supervisors from (800) 742-3333. (65) 6223-8888 has no more/less authority than (800) 742-3333; they just speak different languages. Sometimes, (800) 742-3333 gives (65) 6223-8888 as a ""higher authority"" even though it's not true; I don't know why. Just more misinformation that the call center gives out.I went to San Francisco Airport but they have no offices there. The check-in people have no power or authority and weren't any help. They gave me the number of the San Francisco Singapore Airlines office which was even more useless and clueless than the call center.The real problem was all the misinformation that the web site, call center and offices fed me. I would understand if the web site, call center and offices couldn't help as long as they gave me accurate status and options and explanations. But I got fed way too much misinformation. Despite being stuck overseas for days on end and fed false hope that we'd get a flight by Singapore Airlines' unethical behavior and operation, my family luckily recovered from their medical issues overseas. But my family could have died due to Singapore Airlines callousness and ineffectiveness.I sued Singapore Airlines in Small Claims Court but lost (bad luck). I wasted some of their time and money, though: Singapore Airlines had to send somebody from San Francisco for most of the day. I suggest that everybody do the same; even if you lose, you can be happy that you were a nuisance to them. It's also cheap and easy. I will be filing a complaint with FAA.One dirty little secret of Singapore Airlines: Singapore Airlines flies planes with economy class full and business class mostly empty so they can jack up prices for business class. When they say that the plane is ""full"", that just means that economy class is full so they can upsell you a business class ticket.Another dirty little secret: the clunky reservation system often reports economy class as full for the first few minutes to try upsell you a business class ticket. But, if you join the waitlist and wait 10 or 20 minutes, the flight will suddenly become available/confirmed. Ha, ha! Another dirty trick to try to upsell you a business class ticket, a way to fool you into thinking that business class is your only option.To return home, I figured out a way to use my return ticket for one leg and then buy a ticket on a different airline for the leg that Singapore had constantly full. A quality customer service operation would have suggested this.The in-flight experience is good although I don't really get why people say it is great. The food may be ""great"" for an airline but, of course, if I was on the ground, I'd never choose to eat it. It reminds me of a kid's school lunch. The in-flight entertainment may be ""great"" for an airline but it's hardly the way to enjoy a movie. If I could be somewhere else, I would be.I've flown on EVA Air a lot, too, and, really, it's pretty much the same as Singapore Airlines for me. Singapore Airlines is all hype.","Yelp"
2012-06-05,NA,10,"I am writing to express utter disappointment in my experience with Singapore airlines.I am scheduled to travel in June with two kids aged 3 and 7 from SFO to New DelhiI made this booking well in advance on the 7th of January 2012.My daughter has a health issue 3 days prior to travel and the doctor has advised for her not to travel prior to the 14th of June.  To ensure the health of passengers is not compromised, ensure there is no Liability to Singapore airlines, and in the best interest of my daughter I called Singapore airlines to reschedule my outbound flight after the 14th of June. I also submitted the doctors certificate.The 1-800-743-3333 toll free number connects me to a call center in India that has ZERO authority and I keep getting the run around. I have made 8 calls in the last two days which has been a very frustrating experience. They keep contacting the Singapore Airline local office in Los Angeles and keep hearing back that Singapore airlines will force me to pay the fare difference of $450 each (Total $1350) if I need to push my travel out to the 14th of June inspite of the fact my daughter has a health issue.I am very disappointed that an airline I held in such high regard has ZERO compassion and is NOT willing to change the date at NO COST out of good faith.Update - To my review...The Ground Staff at SFO is TRULY AMAZING....I want to make a special mention for Mr. Loh who was the station leader on the 15th of June!...He was super compassionate and made sure my Wife and Kids got on the plane...Singapore DEL connection was not confirmed - He sent special message to Singapore to ensure my wife gets on Sing - DEL or Sing - BOM connection...Very Very Helpful and Very Very Nice...Call center still sucks - But I guess I'll live with that...","Yelp"

2008-01-08,NA,10,"I have nothing but high praises for Singapore Airlines. Singapore Airlines is the standard that many look up to when it comes to air travel. With their iconic ""Singapore Girl,"" and the high standards the cabin crew are held accountable for, you can expect friendly and down to earth service while cruising to your destination. I have flown with Singapore Airlines on numerous occasions and have been pleased with the service on every single flight. The cabin crew really seem to enjoy what they do and you can see it as they are very customer service friendly. When is the last time you've flown and you've been greeted by name throughout the entire flight? If you fly predominantly in the US I'm sure your answer is probably not too often. Singapore Airlines does the little things right that other carriers fail to do. The onboard services are wonderful too from the food/beverages, in-flight entertainment, and cleanliness of the aircraft. Yes the food is good :) In regards to entertainment none of that continuous looping. It's all on demand so you get to watch or listen when you want. On this trip I flew from Singapore to Tokyo and then from Hong Kong back to Singapore. My flight from Singapore to Tokyo was on a Boeing 747-400 and fortunately I was flying in First. It was so nice to see the SkySuites again. For passengers flying in Business or First you have the option to Book the Cook (BTC). The BTC allows you to pre-order your meal from a list of other menu items. These items range from lobster thermidor to local specialties. For this sector I decided I would BTC the Kyo-Kaiseki, which is a Japanese selection featuring many small plates. No trip on Singapore Airlines in First would be complete without a glass of Dom Perignon. Yes they serve both Dom and Krug. The meal service on SQ is a perfect dining experience in the skies. Everything is done with precision whether it's the direction of your glass with the ""F"" logo lined up to the location of the utensils. First Class passengers are also given amenity kits by Salvatore Ferragamo and sleeper suits by Givenchy. The men's amenity kit included an Incanto Pour Homme Assortment of Eau De Toilette Incanto Pour Homme, after shave emulsion incanto pour homme, lip balm tuscan soul, and hand cream moisturizer tuscan soul. All of the goodies in the amenity kit come in a nice travel bag. The sleeper suits are like sweat pants with a quarter zip matching top. I can't tell you how nice it is to arrive at your destination in with a fresh set of clothes since you can fly in the sleeper suits. In all instances a member of the cabin crew will hang your clothes in the closet for you so you don't need to find a place to store your clothes. Once you're ready to get some rest the SkySuite is transformed into a lie flat bed by a member of the cabin crew. The sky suite is lined with an additional mattress pad for added comfort and topped off with a warm duvet. When you wake up rest assured you will be greeted with a warm towel and a beverage. It's always quite depressing to leave the lovely confines of the SkySuite. Upon deplaning you are thanked by name by the cabin crew. I can't stress enough how nice it is to feel so welcomed when flying Singapore Airlines. My Hong Kong - Singapore flight was on a Boeing 777 in First. While they used a regional aircraft for this route the services were equally superb. They don't have SkySuites on their regional aircraft, but this really isn't such a big deal for their short haul flights. I had initially BTC, the lobster thermidor, but went for the ""Shi Quan Shi Mei,"" otherwise known as ""a complete and perfect chinese culinary experience.""I urge you all to splurge once in a lifetime and fly Singapore Airlines in one of their premium cabins. You won't be disappointed!""Singapore Girl, you're a great way to fly.""","Yelp"
2012-05-07,NA,4,"I am providing feedback to their website and that it experiences a lot of technical problems. While I was booking my flight online, it took many tries before it accepted my meal selection and my membership number. I had to edit the screen many times, and yet my membership number is still not added. In addition, I purchased the Kris package (the middle pricing), so that I can make changes to my flight without charge and that I can earn mileage rewards. However, while I was trying to make changes to my flight to change to a different time, I was unable to do that online and said that I needed to contact 800 support. Which I did, and that leads to my 2nd concern. The contact number for reservations I contacted was +1 (800) 742-3333,and the representatives I spoke with can NEVER hear me and always states that I am breaking up on my end of the line. I originally called them with my cell phone, and I thought that may have been a problem, so I used my landline instead. Even though I used my landline, they still had the same problem. So I provided my phone number for them to call me back, and yet the same problem with ""I can't hear you"" and ""you are breaking up"" is occurring. I was getting really annoyed at this point. I decided to call back during the morning, and try in the afternoon and the evening but I get the same messages. Therefore, I inquired and asked where is the reservation call center located and they said India, which is not a problem, however, not being able to get serviced was the main issue. I believe Singapore Airlines is a preferred airline provider and also given the award to rank number 1 last year as being the best airline, which was one of the reasons why I chose Singpore for my recent vacation. As I was getting frustrated with the customer service experience, I contact the local office in San Francisco, and the number was 650-821-8800 and see if I had better luck. Yet, no luck there either. The voicemail I received wasn't pleasant either, she states that she is very busy and that I won't be returning messages in a timely fashion and to contact the 800 number above instead. I left multiple messages, however, I have not heard from anyone. In the end, I did not have the time and energy to keep dealing with this, so I had to adjust my work schedule and stick with the flight that I have booked. I am very disappointed at Singapore Airlines as I purchased the ticket for convenience and when I needed it, I wasn't able to get the service I paid for. I will not recommend Singapore Airlines to my friends and family. I am giving it 2 stars as the service in-flight was a good experience. The flight attendants were nice and friendly and the food served was good. They had a good selection of movies to choose from.","Yelp"

The stewards and stewardess are always friendly and accomodating.

Inflight entertainment is awesome and I recommend their oriental vegetarian meals. This is my airline of choice for myself and my family. I'm particularly impressed that the cabin crew made extra effort for older passengers who did not understand the standard English and Mandarin. On a recent flight, I was seated next to a solo-flying elder gentleman who needed extra help and I was so glad to see that the cabin crew was accomodating to him. Knowing the SQ standard of service, I would definitely put my parents on SQ when they visit me with a peace of mind . Keep up the good work SQ!","Yelp"

It's been awhile since I've flown, but I can honestly tell you, it's worth EVERY penny if you have to ""slum"" in Commercial First Class. I've flown private in the past, but I think SQ is still better... AND it's part of Star Alliance so I get my points/status as well.Even if not in the longhaul First Class Suites, their normal FIRST CLASS or RAFFLES CLASS are just as great and kick the arses off any other airline carrier. REALLY!From the ambience, service, food, amenities, comfort, offerings, and elegance, you surely will be pampered on these flights.I like the way we have a dedicated First Class Concierge service from beginning to end... ESPECIALLY in Singapore Changi Airport. I have the driver pull up to the First Class Zone outside, and from there, an SQ First Class Customer Service Personnel will greet me at the car, and a porter will take my luggage. The Staff will escort me to a private First Class Check In Lounge where there's a Full Stocked Bar and Refreshments available while waiting. Once checked in and suitcases on their way towards the aircraft, I'm escorted through a Private Hall and into a Special Lane that goes directly to Immigration for a Fast Procedure, and I'm escorted to either the First Class Lounge inside the Departure Terminal or I can shop around the FABULOUS DUTY FREE SHOPS inside the airport. It's like a high end luxury mall within the Singapore Changi Airport!All this happens with the Staff following me, but normally I ask them to go back as I don't need their assistance after check in. In SF, it's not as grandiose the service, however, you still feel special and you KNOW the difference between service from SQ and that of American carriers.... no comparison as SQ is so much better!Please, if you get the chance, fly SQ First Class Suites for longhaul journeys. If you can't, well, at least try them for anything as their Economy Class is still better than the First or Business Class of American carriers (except for space and offerings).","Yelp"

The price was good ($800 R/T to Seoul) and the one thing that does attract me to that airline is their ""Flexi-Saver"" tickets which are only a little more expensive but allow you to change your flight dates relatively painlessly.

So here is my complaint again with the hope my family does not have to endure the kind of service we have had with Singapore Airlines in the past. BTW, I find that Delta and Southwest have far better ground staff customer service than Singapore Airlines, there is no comparison.Basically, we flew out of SFO to Singapore. The check-in staff who I will not mention, was rude, unprofessional and overall, extremely unpleasant, rushed us through the process. We were not given proper weight and size instructions for carry-on baggage which created issues at the gate. But what got to me is the rudeness of the service staff at check-in which I have never experienced before from any airline. Most of the check-in staff are young, probably just out of college. Their training is sub-par. They seem to be unable or incapable of dealing with the fast paced and/or stressful situations as arise when checking in 400+ people for an international flight.","Yelp"

The famed Singapore flight attendants are as good as advertised, maybe some are a little over-trained and robotic but most are genuinely caring and a far cry from United's grouchy prison wardens. If there's a downside, it's that Singapore Airlines' regular passengers are aware of this and seem to be a little more high-maintenance. I noticed the dinner service from SFO to HKG seemed to take forever as row after row of passengers made lengthy special requests as the flight attendants delivered their food.

They do little things like if you fall asleep, they'll put a blanket on you and turn off your reading light. They come by multiple times to make sure you have enough water and drinks. They smile and are courteous when they speak to you. They're definitely not hard on the eyes which helps their image and tend to be in their 20's and sometimes 30's (they live up to their Singapore Girl Ad slogan). I see American/Euro salesmen types hit on the flight attendants on just about every flight. They always handle the situation in a friendly yet firm manner.....It's kind of funny to watch.

I've never liked American airliners as I've found that both food and service is much better on both Asian (EVA, Singapore) and European (Lufthansa) airlines. Anyway, I was able to exchange my UA miles for a couple of Singapore Airline flights. I've only flown on one leg of my travels but I had such an awesome time that I just KNOW flying back to the US will be just as fun. First of all, the airplane is clean and my economy seat had all necessary and convenient amenities. Cupholder up top as well as the usual pull out tray from the side armrest. Magazines in the front pocket were organized, clean, and new (not grimy and scary to stick your hand in). The service was impeccable. The steward/esses were all very refreshing, polite, and efficient. I much prefer them to the grumpy old frumps on its unnamed American partners in the Star Alliance. The food as for airplane food is pretty tasty as well. Make sure to check out their special meals because they offer a TON if you have any dietary restrictions (ranging from Indian vegetarian to all fruit meal and from no carb to Chinese style meal). Finally, most importantly, their IN FLIGHT ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM rocks my world. I didn't sleep a wink on my SFO-ICN(Seoul) flight. Even sitting in Economy, I was able to watch anything and everything on-demand. They literally have nearly hundreds of movies in each category (American, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Bollywood, European, etc) as well as a good international mix of tv programs, CDs, radio shows, etc etc. If I had the money and the choice, I would definitely fly this for all my international flights.","Yelp"

The Asiana lounge in Seoul was good and the Chani lounge was excellent.Seat (2 stars): Something really annoyed me about the seat. The seat itself was wide and when you make the bed, it became fully flat. However, the fact that you have to get up and make the bed was seriously annoying. Also, in ALL legs of my flight, the call button was not working.Food (3 stars): Again, I feel ruthless about saying this...but the food wasn't something that wowed me. In all legs, I opted for beef dishes and they tasted pretty bland. The light bites available were not interesting at all. The presentation and the dinnerware used were pretty darn good though.Drinks (4 stars): High marks for the drink selection - a wide variety of champagne, spirits, beers and wines were available. I am not quite certain how I feel about the wine selection though - they could have done better if they were so keen on advertising how the three of the world-renowed sommeliers helped with the selection. Service (4 stars): I shy away from giving 5 stars because...I don't feel that the service was genuine. Believe me, I love the service - the way they attend to you, smile at you and what not. However, I don't feel it - I don't feel that they mean it. I especially despise when they kneel down to serve you. That's not something that I'd expect from anybody and I sure as hell hope that the flight attendants are not required to do so. In conclusion: It was a good experience, but I really would not waste my money on flying business class on singapore - at all.","Yelp"
2012-07-10,NA,2,"After purchasing a ticket, I needed to make a change on one leg. On Monday evening, I stayed on hold for 1 hours 5 minutes, and gave up. They have an incredibly monotonous repeating messaging about Singapore Airlines being named the best airline in the world. I am sure they are not making that claim for their customer phone service.I actually decided just to go on the website to cancel the ticket; that was not possible.So, this morning, I waited on hold for 25 minutes. I was excited to get a real person, but the connection is awful. She asked me 4-5 times if I was still there. She asked for my record number; that took 3 repeats as she could not understand me -- the bad connection. After she got the reservation number down, she told me to hold while she located the reservation. OK. A couple of minutes she comes back to ask the names on the reservation. OK, another minute on hold. She then came back to ask the date of departure. Hold again. Then, she asked for my flight number, so that she could locate the reservation. Then she asked for the departure city. My god! Wouldn't all of this info be under the reservation number? I then asked to speak to a supervisor, as I had zero confidence that if she ""found"" my reservation that she could actually effect the needed change. I am now at 33 minutes, waiting for a supervisor. Oops, after waiting for another 20 minutes; they cut me off. :( Start over, again.Determined to get this fixed now... I called back. BUT, instead of economy travel, I selected the Kris flyer option. Got thru a lot quicker, about 5 minutes. The attendant told me that in order to change my ticket, she would have to send a note to the Singapore office for approval???? But, she gave me this direct number in Singapore to call for assistance ... (65) 6223-8888. On skype now for 10 minutes... I've got about $10 skype credits, so I'm holding until it runs out.... Still on hold 42 minutes later ..... 57 minutes. Talking to someone helpful!!1 hour, 31 minutes now . I think they have it, but have been on hold for 15 minutes now while they ""process"" the changes.??? World's best airline keeps playing in the recording. ??? Actually, this reminds me of the United Airlines system conversion, which was a crazy mess. Well, it's 2 hours, 1 minute and counting. They were able to get me to the point where I give my cc info. In order to do so, they transfer you to an automated number, where you enter your cc info by keypad; then you're switched back to the agent, who then ""collects"" your info. Unfortunately, they had a problem with my Mastercard, so he asked me to go thru the process again using my Visa. Now, I've been on hold for 10 minutes, while, I suppose, he's trying to ""collect"" the money from my visa. Who knows?Yahoo!!! 2 hours and 6 minutes (on this last call).. I just got my email itinerary confirmation!!","Yelp"

I remember taking a ride on Singapore Ailines which was several years ago... My most memorable flight on this Jumbo Airlines was from SFO to Hong Kong... I really like Singapore Airlines alot what, I remember being on this plane was having fun watching a movie like the very first Lord Of The Rings movie and a comedy tv show like Mr Bean!!! Not only that, I also had a chance to play some very old Nintendo Games like Dr Mario & Final Fight.","Yelp"

As a 5 time a year China flyer I expoerienced how bad these folks are in actually handling customer service issues on ticketing.

2008-08-26,NA,10,"A great airline, as my parents have flown to India via Singapore for nearly 20 years. I had flown via Singapore Airlines and enjoyed the experience. While I've seen lower fares on Air India or even United, I've stuck with Singapore Airlines because of the service and their footprint in India. They go to many Indian cities, as I mainly fly to South India.A note to my single friends, the flight attendants are some of the most beautiful and exquisite women I've met!!! They truly look like they came out of a magazine. They are also very helpful and courteous during the flight, which make them very classy and top-notch in my book. And the times I've had questions at SFO regarding ticketing, they've been super-helpful to myself and all my relatives who might not speak great English.The seats are very comfortable, and the in-flight entertainment system(as others have commented) is a godsend for a 16-20 hr flight.My only negative: seats can be pricey and of course it's a big jump from economy class to business class. Hopefully, one day I can afford a trip on business class. In most instances, you'll make a stop in Singapore. Tip: try to get in early that morning and leave later that day. There's lots to do in Singapore like take bus tours, rest, sleep, shop, etc. The Changi Airport is #1 in the world; an airport terminal like no other.","Yelp"
2010-06-09,NA,6,"Ok maybe I'm a little picky but when an airline proclaims that they are the best in the World I expect above and beyond. The food I will say is very good even for airline food. What I'm deducting a star for was that I was not informed on booking that my flight SFO-HKG did not offer miles- as much as I would have hated UAL I could have banked so many miles. Also wasn't too happy about the 200 screaming babies on this flight- I know theres not much the parents can do and I'm sympathetic but this was the longest 14 hours of my life. FA's are very professional.","Yelp"
2007-07-18,NA,10,"Though it was a few years ago, I had the great pleasure of using my frequent flyer miles to fly business class on Singapore to Bangkok for a cruise. It was my first experience flying on a non-U. S. carrier and I was spectacularly amazed with every aspect of the flight from beginning to end. Reception at the airport was courteous and my hours in the air were so enjoyable, they practically had to drag me off the plane. The food was exceptional, served by lovely flight attendants who anticipated every need. In Singapore, where I had to change planes and wait for two hours, I had the use of the business class lounge - filled with orchids of every hue and a range of snacks and cocktails to make the wait less tedious. I was even able to have a shower after my long flight which made my arrival in Bangkok much more pleasant after the long journey from San Francisco.Of course, I could not normally afford business class airfare but, fromwhat I've heard, economy class service with Singapore is also a cut above - and definitely ranks far superior to that of U. S. airlines. When and if I have the opportunity, there is no questions I would choose this carrier again!","Yelp"

If you are a mile-high couch potato, this is the long distance flight to take.The behind-the-seat thing here is not just a tv. It is a full-fledged computer, with USB ports for memory sticks. You can work view pics or work on your docs. Cool.

2007-01-11,NA,10,"I've always taken Singapore Airlines while traveling to India, and the service is quite good. The seating is ample and comfortable, the flight attendants are friendly and efficient, and you get all the basic requirements for a long flight: a hot towel at departure, free alcoholic drinks, and regularly scheduled meals, which have several options and are actually pretty tasty (I had Indian vegetarian). The in-flight entertainment was also off the hook, with more than 80 movie selections that included Bollywood and other international movies, new and old, in addition to television programming and audio selections.The only thing that sucked about our flight to Mumbai is that we had to transfer twice at Singapore and at Seoul; the Singapore one made sense because we had to go to a different plane, but at Seoul, we had to disembark with our luggage and go through customs only to re-enter the same plane within minutes.","Yelp"

2008-03-24,NA,10,"my grandfather past away in december 2006.it was a very sudden death; we had just discovered he had cancer a couple of weeks prior to his death and already, my family and i had arranged to visit during the christmas holidays. we found ourselves scrambling fly back to taipei earlier. i had steeled myself to seeing him one last time, going over in my mind what i wanted to say to him and also to hopefully cheer him up with my horrible american-inflected mandarin chinese, which he always loved to poke fun at my expense and tell me what a horrible granddaughter i had become, a pox to the family name.i envisioned taking him in a rickety taiwanese taxi to snake alley, where he and i used to bond over snake meat and broth, and i would be able to urge him to eat more meat as his body needed the nourishment and protein and that snake meat made men virile and strong, using his old adages and advice when i was a young child sitting next to him on a wobbly metal stool spooning white-grey snake meat into my little mouth while he conversed with the other older men and showed off his first grandchild, a girl, a ya tou (a derogatory nickname, but used as a term of endearment in our household because it ultimately didn't matter if i was female or male, i was loved by everyone in our family). i thought about all of these things i wanted to say to him, sitting there in the international terminal at sfo. i thought about all of the times we played in the tea garden of his japanese-style tatami house, listening to him speak japanese to his colleagues and classmates from osaka. i remembered his easy transitions in chao-chou dialect, then taiwanese, then the fujian dialect and then back to mandarin. i had so much more to say to my grandfather. i sat on the plane, mostly reminiscing, mostly trying to remember, as my images had all but faded to sepia-infused clips of brief moments or sound or smells or certain repeated actions. the flight attendants knew to let me be. i think they sensed i wasn't on a pleasure voyage. i was offered water frequently, and when i stretched my legs, they were always accommodating and asked if things were ok, if i needed an extra blanket, snack or pillow. things weren't ok, but the kindness and service i experienced on this trip was actually quite touching. even though i didn't shed one single tear before, during or after my grandfather's funeral, i'm sure the impact of his death was written all over my face. he was a man who had lived an amazing and fulfilling life. my only hope is that i carry on his legacy as best i can with my broken mandarin and american attitude. i'm sure he'd be proud.","Yelp"

2007-01-24,NA,4,"For years I have been hearing about Singapore Airlines' excellent service so imagine my excitement when I purchased tickets from SFO to Bangkok on SA. My wife was already in Bangkok for a business trip and I was joining her to spend our holidays in Thailand and Cambodia. I had purchased an economy class ticket and my wife had a business class ticket. We were on the same flight coming back to SF.For a week prior to our departure from Thailand, and at Bangkok and Singapore airports, we tried to upgrade me to business class so my wife and I could sit together on the way back home. SA's employees refused to upgrade me and kept repeating: ""you have a special fare ticket that is not eligible for upgrade"". I offered to pay and they told me that I have to buy a new one-way ticket. No matter what my wife and I said they repeated the same sentence. I felt like I was dealing with robots. It got so frustrating that I lost my patience a couple of times, and I'm known for patient! I do understand that they are not required to upgrade me but SA is the first airline EVER who has refused to upgrade my ticket. Even worse, in Singapore airport, they let my wife into the lounge and they kicked me out! They said: ""Lounge is for business class customers only"" I offered to pay and they refused! I have never been so humiliated in my life!!! Another incident...in Bangkok airport, our baggage was 2 kilos over and they made us take stuff out of our suitcases to bring the weight down. I offered to pay for the extra weight, again no luck. I should mention that every time that I offered to pay for something the SA employees got very irritated with me. I couldn't quite understand why (probably has to do with: ""Damn Americans, they thing they can buy everything"").I do agree that their inflight service is good but any other kind of customer service is non existent. Their employees (not the cabin crew) have a militant attitude and refuse to listen to the customer. They have been programmed to say and do the exact same thing, no matter what the circumstance are. I work for a company that is known worldwide for customer service and I have to tell you that I was very disappointed with SA's customer service, especially having high expectations. My wife and I are contemplating whether we should ever fly SA again. As of right now, our vote is a definite ""no"".","Yelp"
